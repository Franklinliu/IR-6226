Do they honestly think that publicizing a quote like this, on record or off, works to their advantage?
Israeli diplomatic [euphemism for Prime Minister's Office -- DR] sources said: &quot;Clinton isn't relevant and
is out of the circle of influence. Mitchell has taken over the peace process to a great extent and Obama, in
any event, is the important person in this story because he is the one who decides.&quot;
etanyahu to meet Obama, but not Clinton
Eli Bardenstein, Maariv, July 1 2010 [page 7; Hebrew original here and at bottom of post]
rime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is to leave next week for Washington, where he will meet
with US President Barack Obama. Rather curiously, he is not scheduled to meet with Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton in the course of his visit to Washington.
Contrary to his previous visit in March, this time the US administration intends to create the impression,
outwardly at least, that the severe crisis in the relationship has passed and that the relations between the
two countries are as strong as ever. In order to bolster that impression, the two leaders will meet the media
together and will be photographed. As opposed to the previous time, Netanyahu will also be put up at Blair
House, the official White House guesthouse, and not at a hotel.
That said, officials in Washington are waiting apprehensively for the answers that Netanyahu will provide in
the course of the meeting, which is expected to address the transition from the proximity talks that are at an
impasse to direct negotiations. Obama, apparently, will demand that Netanyahu agree to extend the

I know you're embarked on another big trip and wish you well.
I met with Reema Navatany, Ela Bhatt's right hand, whom you know. She sends her greetings and underscored again
what you mean to them. SEWA is on the cutting edge of so many exciting developments.
We had a great conversation on many things, including how much women in the developing world can and must do to
address climate change and drive low tech green industries. In the villages, I could feel the pollution in my eyes and
throat -- so much needs to be done at the local level. Much pollution is produced because of the way women cook, etc.
When I get back, will work up some ideas on this. Delhi's been enshrouded in smog for the last couple days.
The SEWA project I visited 2 hours outside of Delhi was so impressive. Women who were among the poorst of the poor
had become businesswomen capable of traveling to London and Brussels to negotiate contracts with companies for
their embroidery etc We're going to have SEWA play a key role in the Vital Voices summit that you announced that will
take place here next year.
Maria Otero was still here when - arrived so she joined me for the SEWA mtgs.
I also went to one of Rushira Gupta's antitrafficking projects. You know her as we've been working with her thru WH
years. She got the global citizens award at CGI this year. I don't think I've seen worse conditions than what she's trying to
address. In Mumbai we launched an anti- trafficking campaign with Bollywood which brought in new players to the
cause.

I spoke to Liz this morning and explained where we are in terms of the interagency and green lighting invitations (i.e.,
very close, but not there yet). She said that at this point we will probably not be able to attract the number and level of
corporate leaders we originally envisioned for next Tuesday. Liz certainly could pull together something with USGLC
board members and some military leadership, but if she is to only get one bite of the apple with HRC her
recommendation is to &quot;do it right&quot; and move this to January (either the week of the 10th or 241. The idea in January
would be to include members of congress and frame the event as the QDDR making the case for State/USAID's mission
and resources in the new environment. We could take the event in a number of directions (Liz would LOVE to get Gates
together with Clinton) but the idea to launch the QDDR in January with USGLC as the blueprint for supporting
international affairs and the 150 account.
Thoughts? -D

As you know I have good links to the Qataris. Sheikha Mosah's son is the 31/32 year old Crown Prince and she is keen
that he starts to build a wider international profile. He has been appointed head of the Qatar National Food Security
Programme which is designed to deal with Qatar's food security issues its a $30 billion programme. He is aware that
food security is an issue you are majoring on and would love to meet with you in person to discuss this and to explore
potential partnership areas between US and Qatar including possible participation in the US/World Bank Food Security
Fund. He is also keen to talk more generally about US/Qatari cooperation and even suggested they could help out with
the Oil spill problem. There is apparently a Arab Food Security Summit in October 2010 and he would like to discuss Us
participation in that too.

Statement by the Secretary
This Administration has, from the beginning, worked to bring about comprehensive peace in the Middle East, including a
two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. On that issue our approach has been three-fold: (1) to help build the
economy and capacity to govern of a Palestinian state; (2) to renew political negotiations to enable the earliest possible
establishment of that state; and (3) to achieve these in a manner that ensures the security of Israel and of the
Palestinians.

Thirty years I am a FSO and for the first time I feel really really proud to be part of a Secretary's team. Examples
1,Bringing back Farah Pandith. When she left with the change of administration I thought what a waste and figured
there was no chance a Democrat would bring back someone form a Republic administration. But you did!
2,The respect for the input of career officers by the Secretary and the U/Ses is just amazing. It will really help improve
our foreign relations.
3. The Secretary's understanding of the little things and their importance, such as holiday statements.
Well, there are more but we are under staffed and have to get back to work.

ISLAMABAD (AP) Pakistan's prime minister on Wednesday effectively ruled out bringing treason charges against the
country's former military ruler, Pervez Musharraf. Pakistan's Supreme Court recently ruled that Musharraf's imposition
of a state of emergency in 2007 was unconstitutional a decision that raised the possibility he could be accused of
treason. But Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani had said such charges would only be brought against Musharraf if

    <body>U.N. asks Afghanistan to lift election media ban
KABUL, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The United Nations has asked Afghanistan to lift a last-minute ban on media reporting of
violence during Thursday's presidential election, saying the Afghan constitution guaranteed a free press. Afghan
authorities imposed the ban on Tuesday with two decrees, the first barring journalists from reporting any violence in the
country between 6:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. (0130-1530 GMT) on polling day. The second ordered journalists to stay away
from the scenes of any attacks. The government says the measures are intended to prevent reports of violence from
scaring Afghans away from voting. Taliban fighters have vowed to disrupt the election. The United Nations said Afghans
had a right to information, and restricting the media could undermine confidence in the poll. &quot;People need access to
information, not only on polling day but after polling day. The credibility of these elections is directly linked to the
information that they have access to,&quot; said Aleem Siddique, spokesman for the U.N. mission in Kabul. &quot;Its unclear to us
what if any legal basis there would be for such a directive when Afghanistan's constitution guarantees freedom of
expression and freedom of the press. We are making this point to the Afghan authorities,&quot; he said on

    <subject>For the (FR speech: A New American Century</subject>
    <body>I read the Roger Cohen piece and agree that it is v smart. And I've been thinking about the need for a headline/bumper
sticker for the speech. How about &quot;A New American Century&quot;? We cd take on the critics directly and right up front and
make the argument this way (a lot of this is already in the intro, but wd need to be pulled together differently).
1)We live in a new age of diplomacy - we are seeing the limits of force and we face collective problems that require
bringing together a wider array of key players rather than any one nation dictating a solution. Active diplomacy is the
only option. (This is the argument david rothkopf was making to mark landler when we thought landler was doing a
profile - it resonated v well w/ landler.)
2) The U.S. is uniquely suited to lead in these circumstances. a) In situations where many nations must be brought
together that do not trust each other, we are still seen as the most honest broker. b) In situations where many nations
are sitting around the table contemplating a common problem, someone has to step forward and take responsibility for
mobilizing action (which also includes the risk of failure). We are the nation most willing to do that, both because of our
history and our values. (Here is where S can offer personal anecdotes re nations waiting for us to do something) c) in a
world of global problems, we are the most global nation, with the greatest global reach, resources, and connections.
3) We see global leadership not only as a responsibility but also as an opportunity, b/c of our native confidence,
optimism and faith that problems can be solved. We have a chance to shape a genuinely global agenda, focusing on

Dear Richard:

In the past two months, the TAPI project has been resuscitated, largely due to Turkmen President
Berdimukhamedov's personal outreach to his counterparts in Kabul, Islamabad and New Delhi. A &quot;Heads of
Agreement&quot; for the project was recently signed, and there is a possibility that the heads of state of the four
participant countries will meet in Ashgabat in December to give further political impetus to the project. As a
result, the Asian Development Bank, has now
reengaged on the project, and has just agreed to fund technical assistance to the Afghan Ministry of Mines to
assist in negotiations with the other TAPI partners.
I have met twice with Turkmen President Berdimukhamedov since August, and TAPI is at the top of his
agenda.
We all recognize the significant hurdles that TAPI faces, both from a security and commercial standpoint,
but we believe we should do what we can to encourage forward movement on the project:
I have also made General
Petraeus aware of the above.

    <body>(Jerusalem Post) Prime Minister Netanyahu met with Likud MKs and deputy ministers to discuss the U.S.
proposal for a 90-day construction freeze, November 21. In the meeting, Netanyahu told the Likud officials: &quot;I
have a responsibility that includes making the best decision for the state of Israel and its national interests,
foremost, its security.&quot; He continued, 'We still haven't received the written agreement from the Americans on
the basic understandings.&quot; The prime minister assured those attending the meeting, &quot;If we receive a written
agreement, I will bring it to the cabinet and I am sure that the ministers will approve it because it is what's best
for the state of Israel.&quot; He added, &quot;If we don't receive such a document, I won't bring the issue [of a freeze] to
the cabinet.&quot;
Earlier in the day thousands of settlers protested outside the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem against the
potential freeze. National Infrastructures Minister Uzi Landau, an opponent of an additional freeze, addressed

Jim: Sargsian sent this nice message to Gul as he crossed into Turkish airspace today. Understand Gul plans to

the cone of silence starting today. Will see how long it lasts.
Jake — might want to share this with S.
09.02.2010
President Serzh Sargsyan sent a message to the President of the Republic of Turkey Abdullah Gul.
The message states,
&quot;Excellency,
Passing through Turkish airspace, I send my greetings to you and the people of neighboring Turkey.
Our initiative, aimed at the normalization of the Armenian-Turkish relations, holds attention of the international community.
This is a historic moment, indeed, and it is recognized not only by us, but also by the global community. Efforts of the
countries engaged in the region, aimed at the improvement of bilateral relations, are indispensable. I am confident that it
wouldn't be possible to move forward without their support. At the same time, I believe no matter how interested friendly
states might be in a positive resolution of the impasse, there are certain things that can be done only by our two nations.
Mr. President,
I hope you will agree that the Armenian and Turkish peoples assign the main task of getting rid of the stereotypes
regarding each other and establishment of the atmosphere of mutual trust to their respective govemments. We can
achieve results only if there are trust, resolve, and unfaltering stance. A situation when words are not supported by deeds

come up with a FANTASTIC story -- apparently, as per your request, they have tracked down the two kids who won the
peace essay contest in the 90s, and they are doing great things -- one is a teacher, one is a police officer. They are now
reaching out to get permission for you to tell their stories tomorrow night; assuming they will grant it, I am writing up
their stories now and will fax a revised draft to you shortly.
Sorry for the Lamplighter redux; I'll let Lissa know it's off-limits for at least a few years.

Note from Joe Wilson... Sid
Hillary: I'm passing on a note below from Joe Wilson. Sid
Dear Madame Secretary,
It was great to see you, albeit briefly, at the US —Africa business summit. Your speech spoke to the entire
audience as I'm sure you felt from the response. I also appreciate your offer to meet with me the next time we
are both in Washington and would like to take you up on it.
I am now working with a serious American engineering and construction company, Symbion Power, that has
been hugely successful in Iraq and Afghanistan (on fixed cost contracts). It specializes in power plants,
substations and transmission towers and lines. It made its name in Iraq constructing transmission towers and
pulling lines across al Anbar province at the height of the war there. Its business model is to partner with local
companies and to train local employees to do the construction, maintenance and repair, and to provide the
security. In Iraq and Afghanistan they established training centers and graduated over 3000 certified
linemen. They partner with an American Lineman College in Idaho to provide the ed ucation and
certification. We think the model is well adapted to Africa and have already begun work on a training center in
Tanzania, where we will be bidding on all of the upcoming MCC financed power generation and distribution
projects. I have asked Sid to pass a memory stick with a four minute video that explains what Symbion does
and how it does it.
I tell you all this, not to tout Symbion (about which I am very enthusiastic) but let you know that we are doing
much of what you have been advocating in your public comments about human capacity development. The fact
that we have been successful on fixed cost contracts also speaks to your criticism of American companies that
have been milking the government with their cost plus contracts for the last nine years. Our goal is to

Re: Your CFR speech
The draft, sent by separate email, is intended to give you options and ideas. Use as you wish. Several ideas
are at the core of this version: in particular, the concept of the US as a modern global nation and how
that serves our capacity for leadership.
For most policy speeches a generic tone and workmanlike prose are acceptable. But for this one, it is not.
This speech can't afford to be lackluster. It will then be held up in invidious comparison to Obama's
glittering best efforts. Your speech must have, amid the policies, a distinctive and authoritative voice.
Your early draft makes no distinctions between allies or partners; indeed, it barely mentions allies. The early
draft also features a strong malaise theme. Even if rebutted after being raised, the focus is on obstacles
and hindrances, not on achievements, opportunities and what can be achieved. There's no accounting of
progress so far. The effect is downbeat in tone. At the same time, the draft contains passages of vague
and gauzy liberal universalism, while in one line assailing it, an unconvincing juggling act. The notion
that all nations and peoples want the same things as Americans will not fly and is open to derision. It
reflects blithe liberal cultural imperialism, among other things. (See Graham Greene. And, on the
contrary, some nations—and peoples—seek nuclear weapons, like Iran; some don't want to curb global
warming, like China; some don't care about human rights, like most Arab nations; some have contempt
for democracy, including de facto allies like Egypt, not to mention Myanmar; and some are indifferent
to poverty, any number of African kleptocracies.) Also there is some confusion of definitions, for
example, asserting dialogue with adversaries is &quot;strategic engagement,&quot; when that is a concept usually
applied to allies and partners.
The speech must be crafted with a sense of real time and cannot be delivered out of sync with it. Slogans
can become shopworn, especially those that lack analytical, historical and descriptive power. What
served you once, at your confirmation, may not serve again in the same way. The most cogent foreign
policy columnists from Clive Crook of the Financial Times to David Rothkopf of Foreign Policy have
already written columns in the last week on the limits of &quot;soft power&quot; (i.e., &quot;smart power&quot;) and others I
understand are preparing to make similar criticisms. I would use sparingly or not at all. You do not need

Subject: Talk with PM
I called PM el-Keib this morning to get his take on what we were all hearing about TNC final decisions to dismiss the
government, etc. I told him that after the British Ambassador and I had spoken to him and Jalil on Sunday, we had
hoped that these public skirmishes would end and that the government could focus on security and the elections. The
PM said that he had in fact met with Jalil on Monday and agreed to work together for the good of the nation. On
Tuesday, the PM had met with several Council members and had brought along proposed changes in some of the
ministerial portfolios. He sensed there was agreement from the Council members present and thought he had
succeeded in quelling the public discontent. Unfortunately, he continued, more public threats, etc. were issued and by
Wednesday evening he had had enough. That prompted his critical remarks in a press interview demanding that the TNC
stop interfering in the government's business and let him and his government do the work they needed to do without all
this negative background noise. He told me that we should not be concerned about last night's &quot;rumors&quot; and that he
would continue to work to end these fratricidal disputes. For his own role, he said he would be just as happy to give up
his post if matters came to that We will continue to try to reach out to other contacts today to see if in fact the Council
does intend to act against the government. But while the PM is clearly frustrated, he also seemed to believe that the
current strife will not result in any major shake-up, at least for the time being.

Steve Mull is proposing that you do a conference call with the E3 FMs and Ashton sometime this week. Here is the
rationale and background:
The European Union Foreign Affairs Council, comprised of all 27 EU Foreign Ministers, will next meet on May 10. In a
conversation April 26, Bill Burns persuaded the E3 and European Commission to support adding to the agenda of that
meeting a discussion of preparations for the sanctions the EU will impose following passage of a UNSCR.
The European Council, comprised of the EU's heads of government, will meet on June 16-17 — a meeting which could
direct the imposition of such sanctions if we succeed in passing an UNSCR by then.

Subject: DPRK AMCTI&quot; DETENTIONS CONFERENCE CALL
CA/OCS and EAP/K held a one-hour conference call today with the families of the detained journalists. During
the call, we briefed the families on the Swedish Ambassador's consular visit with Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee on May
15; recent progress on efforts to arrange
the release of the two women; an update on the proposed letter from the Secretary;
Media: Although the families have thus far shown restraint from approaching the media to publicize their
story, they are increasingly anxious in response to the DPRK's announcement of a June 4 trial date. They now
feel that a media appeal is necessary and would be helpful to their case, citing the public attention given the
Saberi case. They are considering doing interviews on Larry King Live and/or The O'Reilly Factor.

Re: Iran, Saudi
Had dinner last night (Tuesday, February 16) with Joschka Fischer. We had an interesting conversation on Iran and Saudi
Arabia, among other things. (As you know Fischer is now director of the Nabucco pipeline project.) On Iran, harsh,
targeted sanctions are absolutely necessary, but are most effective diplomatically when always coupled with an offer to
negotiate. The iron fist in the velvet glove approach achieves several objectives: According to Fischer's intelligence,
Ahmanijehad wished some negotiated settlement but was blocked. The regime has splits at the top. Perhaps true,
perhaps not. But constantly pushing negotiations alongside sanctions puts additional pressure on internal divisions,
whatever they are. Extending an open hand while brandishing a stick closes diplomatic and political room to maneuver
for Iran. Its refusal to accept the open hand justifies application of the stick. Even when sanctions are enforced it always
remains useful to say another way is open. The damage done to Iran is therefore the result of its own choice. This
approach also aids the opposition. A purely condign sanctions strategy can contribute to the regime's will to punish and

General Jim Jones has spent a lifetime serving our country with honor and distinction. In war and in peace, from foreign
battlefields to the highest levels of our government, he has exemplified the best traditions of the Marine Corps and the
United States. I have been honored to serve with him and to call him my friend. As National Security Advisor he brought
a steady hand and clear vision to an unforgiving agenda. His leadership was crucial in winding down the combat mission
in Iraq, refocusing the war in Afghanistan, and advancing our nation's interests and values around the world. America is
more secure and the world is more stable because of Jim's tireless efforts. He will be sorely missed, but I am pleased
that Jim will now be able to spend more time with his wife Diane and their wonderful family.

2. Have received $246,423 in credit card donations from 2,736 donors
3. Have received $ 9,760 in ACH donations from 118 donors
4. Have received $50,144 in mailed in checks/cash from 276 donors
So in total we have received $344,107 in pledges and donations from 6,908 donors
On average this is about $50 per donation/pledge. If you excluded the ten dollar pledges/donations the
average donation was $98 dollars.

I tried to get them to switch the agenda to include Egypt instead of China — they are determined to raise China but we
agreed that it will come last — so right now there will be a quick mention of Egypt at the top by Elisa Massimino from
Human Rights First (who will open the meeting and serve as traffic cop). Then Karen Ryan from the Carter Center will
raise DRC, followed by Ken Roth of Human Rights Watch who will raise Af/Pak issues, then David Kramer (former A/S in
DRL now at Freedom House) raising China issues. The goal is to allow 15 minutes at the end for S (along with Dan Friend
and Harold ) to raise Gitmo issues and ask for their support. We now have 45 minutes for the meeting

2010: global cracks, human prospects (part II)
No•
a■iid Hayes, 2 January 2010
Subjects:
• Democracy and government
• International politics
More openDemocracy authors reflect on a volcanic decade in global politics - continued from part I
openDemocracy deputy editor David Hayes asked openDemocracy writers to reflect on the decade that has passed and
the one that lies ahead by considering three questions:
1)What was the most significant trend in the century's first decade?
2) What do you most hope for, and most fear, about the decade to come?
3) What idea do you see fading and/or emerging in 2010 and beyond?
• Sidney Blumenthal
The greatest challenge for the early 21st century is that China's leadership has contempt for much of the international
order and many of the international organisations developed since the second world war. In pursuit of its narrow and even
crude understanding of its interest, China will constantly abuse and break international rules, protocols and bodies. Its
willful destruction of the Copenhagen summit on climate change reveals the pattern. Its mercantile currency policy in a
beggar-thy-neighbour approach, environmental degradation, and disdain for human rights and the rule of law generally
are the obvious reflections of its despotism. Through its rough and strange neo-imperialism, in Africa especially but also
elsewhere, China is able to gain help, partly through economic intimidation, in its international forays to repel or strike
down the responsibilities of internationalism.
Internally, China is a prison of nations, an empire similar to imperial Russia and the Soviet Union, and may also be the
most unequal industrial country in distribution of income. China's power is increasing, but the authoritarian regime is
hardly the wave of the future as some awestruck worshippers of raw power and money (whether investment bankers or
ex-Marxists) imagine. The system is inherently unstable, which accounts for its rigid currency policy (at root a fear of
operating on other than a virtual slave-labour standard, of turning its poverty-stricken millions into consumers with real
choice, and ultimately of letting go even a little bit).
In the long-term the tyranny of the one-party state and its military rule is at odds with the new economic classes of
entrepreneurs and professionals it has fostered. China's growing economic power is accompanied by expanding
arrogance, demonstrated not least in the incivility and rudeness with which President Obama was treated on his trip there.
China's regime lacks an ideal other than a communist gloss on Confucian uniformity, itself based incoherently on reckless
economic development, for example in the areas of currency, environment and labour; it has no &quot;soft power&quot;, not just
because of the coarseness of its supposed diplomacy, but also because its cultural appeal does not travel. China forces
its way through coercion of one sort or another.
The next decade will see how flexible or inflexible its rulers are and how secure their system is. The brief effort at a
rhetorical gesture by some in the Obama administration who floated the turgid phrase &quot;strategic reassurance&quot; was risible
and did not last. For now, the west has no policy to deal with China as it is. The place to begin is on currency.
The most powerful idea for the 21st century is the equality of women. It is the idea most feared by those - from the Vatican
to the Taliban - arrayed against modernity, the still vibrant project of the Enlightenment. Someday the United States may
even have a woman president. It took fifty years after granting the vote to African-Americans to pass a constitutional
amendment giving it to women. Perhaps the distance between electing the first African-American president and the first
female one will not be so great.

Subject: Monterrey Consulate
Please pass to the Secretary
Madame Secretary,
I wanted to follow-up with you on my earlier note about the security situation in Monterrey. We have been working
very closely with Pat Kennedy to assess all of our options. Pat has shown tremendous flexibility and has provided
excellent counsel.
As we looked further into the Aug 20 shooting incident at the American School, it became clear that there many
competing versions about the causes behind the incident. We decided that it is best to leave this matter to local law
enforcement officials and to concentrate our review on whether it is possible to provide adequate security for the
children of U.S. personnel in Monterrey.
Our discussions with police and other security officials made clear that local police and private patrols do not have the
capacity to deter gangs and cartels from areas around the schools attended by the children of U.S. personnel. Local
authorities, we found, are not able to respond in a predictable and effective manner to calls for assistance. Given the
increasing level of violence that is occurring all over Monterrey, including near where our children go to school, we
determined that the only immediate, practical, and reliable way to reduce the security risks for all children is to relocate
them to the United States.
We are working with Pat Kennedy on the appropriate mechanism to formalize these arrangements. I have also advised
Secretary Espinosa and Nuevo Leon Governor Medina that we are moving in this direction. In parallel with this, I
recommitted to our Mexican counterparts that we will continue to do everything possible to support their efforts to
improve the security environment in Monterrey and other parts of the country.

    <body>Longtime Clinton confidant Blumenthal to become Clinton advisor
Tue, 06/23/2009 - 1:00pm
Longtime journalist and former Clinton White House advisor Sidney Blumenthal will become a special advisor
without portfolio to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, The Cable has learned. Blumenthal refused to comment.
But sources say he is filling out the paperwork and disentangling himself from other obligations as he moves to
become a special advisor to the secretary whose presidential campaign he helped advise. The position would
not require Senate confirmation.
Clinton, who is recovering from surgery to repair a broken elbow, has been building her team at the State
Department, while establishing her credentials as a team player supporting and amplifying her former
presidential rival's foreign-policy vision. Sources close to her says she will prove indispensable to Obama, a
point several Obama aides also made to Politico's Ben Smith in a piece noting the relatively background role
she has played in these early months. The planned addition of Blumenthal, a longtime confidant of the Clinton
family and a fierce defender of Bill Clinton's presidential legacy, could indicate she plans to raise her profile.
(Blumenthal is probably Clinton's best speechwriter, a friend notes.)
In the foreign-policy arena, Blumenthal advised former President Clinton on U.S.-British relations, and first

aptember 26, 2010
John Rentoul: The party voted for David
Miliband but got the Panda instead
New Labour leader won't stand a chance against David
Cameron
The result is the worst possible for the Labour Party. A decisive victory for Ed Miliband would have been one thing. The
party would have made the wrong decision, but it would have done so with its eyes open and with the leader's legitimacy
unchallenged.
Instead, Ed Miliband lost the election in two parts of Labour's electoral college, among MPs and among Labour Party
members, but won thanks to a 60-40 margin the other way among trade union members on a very low turnout.
If he had won by a clear margin I would have said that Labour had chosen the Panda as its leader. He is soft, cuddly and
panders to every oppositional instinct in the party. There has been no position taken by the Labour government of which
he was a member that he was not prepared to trash if he thought Labour members would like it. Tuition fees, Iraq, the
third runway for Heathrow: you name it, he disowned it. Even, in the case of the third runway, a policy for which he had
direct ministerial responsibility. There has been no part of the manifesto, which he wrote, that he has not been prepared to
ditch.
But that is not what the party did. Labour Party members chose David Miliband. Labour MPs chose David. The party itself
voted for what Ed Miliband tried to dismiss as the &quot;New Labour Establishment&quot;, in other words, the supposedly hated
Blairites. The party read the signals from the voters correctly. It knows that, although it didn't do as badly as it feared in the
general election, a lurch to the left was not the answer. Party members and MPs took on board Tony Blair's warning that
Labour lost because Gordon Brown &quot;moved a millimetre&quot; to the left of New Labour. They did not fall for the argument that
Labour did better than expected by moving a millimetre to the left and, therefore, to do better still they needed to move a
couple of centimetres further to the left.
They did not think that, because Labour has pulled level in the opinion polls, the next election is in the bag. They know
that the opposition party often moves ahead of the government in the opinion polls within months of an election. They also
know that Labour's poll rating is artificially inflated by the absence from the fray of the Liberal Democrats as a protest
party, and they know that this protest vote cannot be relied upon in a general election.
The Labour Party and Labour MPs got it right, and the election was won by an operation run by the trade union machines.
That means that Ed Miliband, who would have struggled against David Cameron in the House of Commons in any event,
is going to be roasted every week.
Every week, the Prime Minister is going to point out that the Leader of the Opposition does not have the support of the
members on the benches behind him. Not only that, he does not have the support of the members of his party in the
country. Every week, Cameron is going to portray Miliband as the place person of the trade union bosses and the
beneficiary of a boss-politics stitch-up.
If Ed Miliband had won the party members but lost among MPs, which is what I expected, the Conservatives would have
teased him in the Commons, but he would have had as much legitimacy as lain Duncan Smith - the choice of the party
activists against the wishes of his MPs. No wonder Ed was the &quot;cork-popper&quot; candidate in Conservative HQ. The way

Do they honestly think that publicizing a quote like this, on record or off, works to their advantage?
Israeli diplomatic [euphemism for Prime Minister's Office -- DR] sources said: &quot;Clinton isn't relevant and is out of
the circle of influence. Mitchell has taken over the peace process to a great extent and Obama, in any event, is the
important person in this story because he is the one who decides.&quot;

&lt;http://www.scribd.com/doc/33775924/Maariv-Jul01-10-Netanyahu-Will-Not-Meet-Clinton&gt; Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu is to leave next week for Washington, where he will meet with US President Barack Obama. Rather curiously,
he is not scheduled to meet with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the course of his visit to Washington.
Contrary to his previous visit in March, this time the US administration intends to create the impression,
outwardly at least, that the severe crisis in the relationship has passed and that the relations between the two countries
are as strong as ever. In order to bolster that impression, the two leaders will meet the media together and will be
photographed. As opposed to the previous time, Netanyahu will also be put up at Blair House, the official White House
guesthouse, and not at a hotel.
That said, officials in Washington are waiting apprehensively for the answers that Netanyahu will provide in the
course of the meeting, which is expected to address the transition from the proximity talks that are at an impasse to
direct negotiations. Obama, apparently, will demand that Netanyahu agree to extend the construction freeze in Judea

    <subject>Fw: Micheletti Step-Aside?</subject>
    <body>To All:
Yesterday, when I left Tegucigalpa, we used the departure to put more pressure on M. I called a top M aide and said I
was leaving, and that if my message in Washington was that M refused to help us help him, we would have to take our
own steps to make clear our position on Honduras. (They assume that means visas stay revoked and more could be
pulled.) We preferred to achieve our objectives through a patriotic gesture on M's part (a step-aside) but we have to
protect our principles and our interests in the region. Washington would be very disappointed that M refused to
cooperate with the country that has done the most to promote support for the October 30 Accord and promote support
for elections in his country. Moreover, M would be passing up a chance to go down in history as a statesman as
opposed the man who launched a coup.
Last night the aide called Hugo to say that M had considered this again and was sensitive to our arguments. He had
decided to make a speech today (November 19) to announce that he as &quot;absenting himself&quot; for the days preceding the
election through December 2 —the date of the vote on Z's restitution in the Congress. The latter is a significant date,
because if Z wins the vote, M is gone, and if Z loses the vote, M has no reason to stay to keep Z out. M will leave the
country in the control of a sort of executive council.
This afternoon M's staff shared with us the draft of a speech that M plans to make tonight at 7:00 pm EST (6:00 pm in
Honduras). We have been suggesting edits to the text, which M has accepted.
This is Honduras, so we will wait to see what happens at 7:00 pm. If M goes through with it, we will launch calls to key

Huma, I wanted to relay to you the sincere sentiments of appreciation expressed by the PM's Office and the MFA for the
very personal touch by the Secretary notifying the PM about postponement of the trip. Not lost on the GPNG is the fact
that the entire trip was postponed, not the PNG portion. As you can imagine that is politically very significant.
Naturally, we stand ready to reconstitute the program or enhance it should the trip move forward at a later date. We
got luck today w/the weather—not a rain cloud in sight.
Safe travels, and hopefully we will work together at a later date. Best of luck with the Haiti recovery effort!

    <subject>Fw: (Reuters) Netanyahu presents U.S. settlement plan to cabinet</subject>
    <body>JERUSALEM (Reuters) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented a U.S. plan to his cabinet November 14
that would extend a freeze on West Bank settlements for 90 days in return for diplomatic and security incentives.
Washington wants Israel to renew a freeze on settlement building in efforts to resume peace talks with Palestinians,
who in September halted negotiations after just a few weeks when Israel refused to extend a 10-month settlement
freeze.
Under the U.S. proposal, if Israel extended the freeze Washington would pledge not to seek further extensions and to
veto any attempts at the United Nations to force a unilateral peace settlement.
U.S. security aid to Israel would also be upgraded.
&quot;I will insist that in any proposal Israel's security needs will be addressed, both in the immediate term and regarding
the threats facing us in the coming decade,&quot; Netanyahu said in public comments before the cabinet meeting.
The prime minister has previously said any settlement moratorium will not apply to areas around East Jerusalem that
Israel captured during a 1967 war and the Palestinians want as the capital of a future state.
One official in Netanyahu's office said the proposal had &quot;positive elements&quot;. Israeli political sources said a narrow
majority in Netanyahu's security cabinet, which is ultimately responsible, would likely support accepting the U.S.
proposal.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton shared the plan at a meeting in New York last week, Netanyahu said, adding that
U.S. and Israeli teams were still negotiating a final formula.
A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said there had been no official word regarding a renewed
Israeli freeze on housing starts in the occupied West Bank.
&quot;An official Palestinian commitment will come only after President Abbas hears officially from the American
administration what is going on between them and the Israelis,&quot; Nabil Abu Rdainah told Reuters.
Palestinian officials in private have expressed anger over U.S. incentives to get Israel to prolong the partial freeze,
saying they were effectively bribing Israel to fulfill basic international obligations.
Israeli officials said Netanyahu, who faces a tough political sell within his own coalition on the settlement issue, had
pushed Clinton for the broad understandings.
Settler leaders, who said acceptance of the proposal would represent &quot;a fundamental collapse&quot; of the government's
integrity, called an emergency meeting to discuss the issue.
Under the U.S. plan, Israel would declare a further, three month suspension of construction in the West Bank, land it
captured in a 1967 war where Palestinians seek a state. Any building launched since the original moratorium ended late
in September would be frozen, a diplomatic source said.
Among the pledges offered to Israel by Washington was a guarantee to veto any resolutions brought to the United
Nations Security Council that seek &quot;to impose a political settlement on Israel,&quot; the source said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
The United States would also undertake to veto resolutions deemed anti-Israel in the United Nations and other
international organisations, a move that could make Israel less vulnerable to threats made by some Palestinians to
declare statehood unilaterally in the event that peace talks fail.

Hi Cheryl:
Today, I was able to have good preliminary conversations with Jean Bonilla and Lorraine Hariton in EEB. Both Jean and
Lorraine are very excited about the opportunity to partner on this new area for the Secretary and provided me with
some very valuable insight and discussion on how we can partner and collaborate on programming and initiatives
together.
I also included the information from ECA —that we discussed in the document. The INR meeting was cancelled today and
will be scheduled for early next week. As I move around the Department and talk with other officials in the coming
week, I believe we will be able to build out a more robust Work Plan and garner some great collaborations on this
effort.
Additionally, in a recent conversation that I had with Governor O'Malley from Maryland, I shared with him that the
Secretary was launching a new effort that would assist state and local leaders with respect to their global affairs
portfolios. The Governor was extremely excited and remarked that he has some great idea for the Secretary about how
the Department can be a major value-add to local governments. He told me that he wants to be very engaged in what
we do in the Department in this area. I will be scheduling a time to meet with him and his economic team once my
position has been announced. He wanted me to let her know that he had been thinking about her and wanted to reach
out and did not know how and then I walked in and we began to have this discussion and he said — what a way to start
his year for 2010 — something coming to reality that he had been thinking about.
Also, Maura Pally in ECA forwarded me a meeting that I took with the Deputy Director of the National Lieutenant
Governor's Association. They were in town working on their upcoming Washington meeting. They too are very excited
about what we are planning and want to work very closely with us in the coming months as we launch this effort. Lt.
Governor Bill Bolling in VA is the current Chair.

Yes -- Stephens is in DC all day, we can work with Ops on the call. I don't think we need to push the Angolans more than
15 minutes so should be fine. Should I move forward and adjust?

Subject: If bilateral talks fail, a regional approach
For your Sunday reading, a summary of an interesting proposal by former Jordanian foreign minister Marwan Muasher.
&quot;Palestinian-Israeli Direct Talks: The Case for a Regional Approach&quot;By Marwan Muasher (Carnegie Endowment Bulletin,
August 2010)
Marwan Muasher – former Jordanian foreign minister, ambassador, and deputy prime minister – advocates a regional
settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, capitalizing on the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative. His approach depends first
on securing end-game &quot;deposits&quot; from all parties: The parties would offer hypothetical commitments that they might
not be willing to give at the onset, but that can be &quot;deposited&quot; with the U.S. and committed to only if the other side is
willing to do the same. Saudi Arabia's deposit, for instance, would outline and agree to a package that included details
about Jerusalem. The Saudi package would also promise to secure Arab and Muslim backing for the painful compromises
the Palestinians would need to accept.
Muasher advocates a similar approach to the Syrian track—asking Syria to deposit end-game commitments in return for
full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. In their deposits, the Saudis and the Syrians must clearly commit to
address the inclusion of Hamas and Hezbollah in any regional agreement. The Arab states would not only have to end all
logistical, financial, and military support for these two groups, but they would have to assume responsibility for
delivering these two actors, helping to transform them into political players. Israel's deposit would spell out its
commitment to a solution based on 1967 borders and a return of the Golan.
According to Muasher, these deposits would make it much easier for President Abbas to engage in talks aimed at ending

I want to thank all three of you for the tremendous support you have given me and WHA since the beginning of the
Obama Administration. I am especially grateful to the Secretary for the confidence she has shown in me, and her
willingness to make me part of her team. I consider this an enormous honor and I hope that I have met her
expectations. I look forward to continuing to be part of her team from Brazil.
I am preparing a &quot;Last Thoughts&quot; paper for the Secretary, which will look back over the past ten months, identify
accomplishments, and point toward what I think needs to come next. I will share this paper with Arturo.
Regarding Honduras, Craig did heroic work there this week, and we are moving toward a potentially big step by
Micheletti that would open space for many of our allies to support the elections. As we move forward, it is important to
note that the solution to the crisis is becoming more and more Honduran with each step in the process. This is a good
thing, because it increases the chances that the resolution will be peaceful, enduring, and a platform for the political
reforms that must come next.
It is worth highlighting that the Secretary, through her outreach to both sides and her clear commitment to the future of
Honduran democracy, has positioned us as an honest broker in this dispute. The only honest broker. Everyone one else
in this drama -- from Insulza to the Brazilians to the Albinos -- has other agendas and motives in play. In this regard, we
are the only hope of the Honduran people. The internal dialogue taking place, within the de facto regime, among its
supporters, and between the Micheletti and Zelaya camps, is the product of our engagement. No one else could have

Dear Lanny,
I'm in Asia for the next ten days, so I'm copying George and asking him to read your email below and then contact you to discuss
your ideas. Thx for your concern, and thx also to George for following up w you. Hillary
souimate who, like me, agreed with every word of your speech.
&quot;The Secretary did a SUPERP job and the audience responded with a
standing ovation. They loved her. I am grateful and relieved. We
many compliments.
Now I believe we can be helpful through the back door in breaking the stalemate.
We have an idea. Off the record - and you know I have never violated my word to you that only you know of my and efforts at
the time of the suspension of the settlements moratorium - we have an idea. But must remain back door and only becomes official
when principals propose and agree.
You said you could put me in touch with someone we both can trust to hear what we see as a way to break the stalemate.
I have two suggestions for us to talk to - old friends who know me and whom you trust:
I) Geo Mitchell - did you know Geo was my first &quot;boss&quot; in 1971 in a presidential campaign - Ed Muskies? (I was the &quot;national youth
coordinator&quot; when every &quot;youth&quot; I knew, including Hillary Rodham and Bill Clinton, was for George McGovern)
2) Jim Steinberg - my buddy from my WH days.
Or whoever you suggest. We want to meet off-the-record, no one can know, to share this idea.
As to your speech - it must get wider circulation.
I am going to write about it in my Hill column next week (also appears on Huffington and Daily Caller). Can you have someone send
1 to me ASAP?)
My heart truly was tilled with gratitude and admiration for the courage you showed last night - courage because your words were
tough love equally for both sides.
Tough love for both sides.

Subject: [undp-washington] UNDP UPDATE ON THE HAITI EARTHQUAKE
UNDP UPDATE ON THE EARTHQUAKE IN HAITI
Casualties and damage from the earthquake are so extensive that overall assessments are still incomplete. UN
assistance to the victims has been complicated by the fact that a significant number of UN personnel, including
UNDP colleagues, serving in the country are unaccounted for. The headquarters of the UN Mission and
peacekeeping operations, MINUSTAH, collapsed in the tremors and many people are still trapped inside.
UNDP Administrator Helen Clark is meeting with the Secretary-General and other senior personnel continually
today and the whole UN system is mobilized to bring the UN team in Haiti all necessary assistance as soon as
possible to assess the damage, loss of life and injuries, and to support the national and international response
efforts.
The building which housed UNDP and a large number of sister agencies - UNFPA, WFP, UNEP and UNIFEM
- was partially damaged, and rescue workers are continuing to search through the rubble. Senior UNDP officials
are in close touch with the Resident Co-ordinator, Kim Bolduc, who is operating out of a MlNUSTAH logistics
base near the airport. She reports that the situation is critical for staff with limited access to food, water,
sanitation and medical attention.
In the coming hours UNDP will be dispatching additional staff, including stress counselors and medical doctors,
as well communications equipment, to Port-au-Prince. Arrangements are also being made to evacuate injured
and non-essential staff out from the country and to care for and assist its many local staff members. Due to the
limited logistics capacity in Haiti, most of the staff and equipment needed will be transiting through the
Dominican Republic. Plans for strengthening the UNDP office in that country are already underway.
Administrator Clark says UNDP will do whatever it can to support its staff in Haiti and to equip them with the
necessary tools to help the Haitian people on what will be a long road to recovery. As a first step she expects a
UN emergency response team lead by UN Office of the Coordinator for Humanitarian Assistance (OCHA) to be
on the ground shortly to help co-ordinate humanitarian relief efforts.

and allegedly overnight at the residence of the Libyan PermRep in Englewood. Rothman has called our office directly
and threatened holy war and Fox news &quot;if the State Department allows this.&quot; A few minutes ago we also got a letter
from Sen. Lautenberg to the Secretary expressing similar concerns. The anger is of course over the &quot;hero's welcome&quot; for
Megrahi. An action memo for Jim to consider on how to deal with Qaddafi's visit is in the works, but I fear Rothman will

A Last-Minute Meeting On Afghanistan
President Obama convened a last-minute meeting of his national security team tonight to discuss the language that his
administration will use to describe its new strategy for Afghanistan. Two administration sources confirmed that the
meeting, which began at 5:oo pm, included cabinet officials like Defense Secretary Robert Gates. The officials would not
describe the meeting and said that no other news organizations were being given any background briefing. That suggests
that the meeting was akin to a pre-game rally session by the commander-in-chief: he wants to gert everyone from Gates to
Gen. Stanley McChrystal to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on the same page before the president's Tuesday speech.
Before young officers at West Point, Obama will announce his decision about Afghanistan to an increasingly skeptical
nation and a Democratic Congress that is threatening to condition its budgeting on identifiable off-ramps and
timeframes. Obama is expected to announce that he'll order several Army combat brigades to Afghanistan -- about
30,00o troops in all, most of them to be tasked with more rapidly standing up Afghanistan's indigenous army. His speech,
as described in broad terms by advisers last week, will be short and serious. His challenge is to persuade Americans that
the war in Afghanistan is winnable, as Americans tend to give their presidents significant leeway so long as they believe
that the president is confident in his strategy. Officials said last week that while would outline a clear exit strategy, he

Ms Mills,
I got your email address in a message from my good friend, Kathleen Townsend, several months ago but have never
wanted to bother you directly. However, as the former head of humanitarian operations at USAID under Pres. Clinton, I
thought it appropriate to commend you and your colleagues on the excellent job that is being done in the early days of
the USG response to the tragedy in Haiti. The deployment of Coast Guard and SouthComm resources, the immediate
organization of an interdepartmental group to coordinate USG efforts, the deployment of multiple USAID urban search

    <subject>Fw: Benghazi update (1200 local)</subject>
    <body>Update from Rep. Stevens in Benghazi, based on largely on info from acting PM Afi Tarhouni and acting FM
Salah Bishari:
• TNC caretaker cabinet/members were up until 4am following events in Tripoli and discussing plans for
the coming days. Tarhouni said the TNC has been in constant communication with its people in Tripoli,
including both fighters and those entrusted with implementing the stabilization plans. Rebels in Tripoli,
in coordination with the TNC, have begun to set up checkpoints inside the city and guard public
buildings
• TNC chairman Abd al Jalil and PM Jibril made statements to the media last night, urging people to
refrain from revenge attacks and destruction of public buildings.
• There has so far been &quot;no bloodbath&quot; or serious looting.
• The capture of Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi and Mohamed al-Qadhafi is significant. The TNC, including
Abd al-Jalil himself, intervened with rebels surrounding Mohamed's house to ensure that they did not
harm him. They understood that it would be harmful to the revolution and the TNC if he were
killed. These events were captured live by Al Jazeera in interviews with Mohamed. Both brothers are
in rebel custody (at this time, it is unclear to us exactly who is holding them, however).
• Per Tarhouni, the next steps are: 1) find Muammar Qadhafi; 2) issue a statement announcing the end of
the Qadhaii regime and the start of the interim period under the TNC (TNC staff have begun drafting
this statement already); 3) insure the delivery of essential services and commodities (esp. addressing the
acute shortages of fuel, children's milk, and medication for blood pressure and diabetes); and 4) move
the TNC to Tripoli.
• Regarding the move to Tripoli, Tarhouni said security arrangements would need to be made before they
could send the TNC leadership to the capital. We have heard from another contact that some TNC
members are already making plans to fly to Misurata and the Western Mountains, possibly as early as
today, and from there drive to Tripoli.
• Request for assistance: Tarhouni, who also holds US citizenship, said the items listed above (gas, diesel,
baby milk, and medicine) are urgently needed in Tripoli and recommended that the USG ship those
items directly to Zawiya's Port and publicize such assistance as soon as feasible (in coordination with
the TNC). Ile said this would bring the US even more goodwill than it has already earned here.

    <body>One thing I forgot to mention - Bill B and Mike Posner recommend that you release the below statement. Apparently
Hamidi's execution is imminent. With your approval we'll put out.
DRAFT STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
Urging Iran to Respect the Fundamental Freedoms of its Citizens
The United States is deeply concerned that Iran continues to deny its citizens their civil rights, as well as to intimidate
and detain those Iranians who seek to hold their government accountable and who stand up for the rights of their
fellow citizens. We remain troubled by the case of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, who garnered international attention
for her verdict of death by stoning. While the Iranian government later stated she would not face execution by stoning,
her fate has been left unclear. We are also troubled by reports that Ebrahim Hamidi, an 18-year old charged with
homosexuality, faces imminent execution despite the fact that he is currently without legal representation. Neither of
their cases have proceeded with the transparency or due process enshrined in Iran's own constitution and their lawyer,
Mohammad Mostafaei, felt that he had no other choice than to flee Iran after he had been questioned by authorities
and his family members had been detained.

Israel's refusal to halt construction of new settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. However, Israel must
provide specifics about its position on core issues such as what a Palestinian state would entail, the status of Jerusalem
and the return of refugees, Fayyad said, adding that the lack of a new settlement freeze erodes trust in the process.

    <body>.&quot;IsraePaestinialpeace talks expected to resume in Se4zitember&quot; Washst
&quot;The Middle East peace process resumed in May, after a hiatus of 19 months, but it stalled
again over the terms of moving from indirect talks, mediated by U.S. envoy George Mitchell,
to direct negotiations.
.israel insists it is ready for direct talks, provided there are no preconditions. The Palestinians
are ready provided there is a clear agenda. Israel says an agenda means preconditions.
Resolving the snag over terms is crucial, diplomats say.&quot; Washpost
The former NY Times reporter Judy Miller likes to address me as &quot;gloomy gus&quot; or some such
thing when I encounter her. Well, stand by for some more gloom.
The second Camp David talks failed because Dennis Ross and company placed the
Palestinian delegation in a position in which a &quot;solution&quot; was demanded and expected by the
Americans and Israelis on the basis of bargaining during the negotiations themselves.
This seemed reasonable at the time to the US and Israeli negotiators. After all, is this not
what one does? Should not the outcome be the product of the dialectic of argument and
persuasion?
Arabs generally think not. They tend to believe that negotiations are for the purpose of of
arranging the details of outcomes that are understood in advance of the conference itself. For
them, anything else is an attempt to win concessions through trickery.
&quot;The Palestinians are ready provided there is a clear agenda. Israel says an agenda means
preconditions.&quot;
Hello! What kind of nonsense is this? Have we learned nothing?
And then, there is the &quot;little&quot; matter of the non-participation of Hamas. Does the Obama
Administration really think that this 600 pound gorilla can be ignored? Is this some sort of
scheme on the part of Natanyahu, and &quot;the boys&quot; to discredit Abbas so that an isolated
Hamas can be attacked and destroyed later?

The Secretary's Call Sheet for
Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari
Purpose of Call: To express your condolences regarding the deaths of Iraqi MFA personnel in the August 19 attack on
the Iraqi Foreign Ministry.
want to personally express my heartfelt condolences to you for the savage attack on the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign
Affairs today and for the tragic loss of so many Iraqi lives around Baghdad and particularly at the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.
El I remember fondly our meeting at the MFA in April — I was proud to be the first senior U.S. official to attend a meeting
there, and I was deeply saddened to hear that your Ministry was attacked.
CI This is a trying day for Iraqis and the Government of Iraq, but brutal attacks like these only deepen the need for
dedicated Iraqi like you and those in your Ministry, to remain committed to the new Iraq.
0 Know that the United States will continue to stand by Iraq as it faces these challenges.
Background: On Wednesday, August 19, what appears to be a series of VBIED and additional rocket attacks in Baghdad
resulted in the bloodiest day in Baghdad since the June 30 withdrawal of U.S. forces from urban areas. Although exact
numbers have not been confirmed, media is reporting that approximately 75 people were killed across Baghdad with
over 100 injuries. The most devastating attack appears to have been against the Iraqi MFA, where a VBIED was

Bill Clinton raising bucks for Maloney
Former President Clinton will be keeping his commitment to host a fundraiser for Rep. Carolyn Maloney, who
has irritated other Democratic leaders by announcing she*s challenging Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) in a
primary.
The July 20 fundraiser with Clinton*in Manhattan had been in the works for months, well before Maloney
announced she would be running against Gillibrand. The former president has not endorsed in the race for his
wife*s former Senate seat and is not planning to issue an endorsement, according to his spokesman.
Clinton held a fundraiser for Gillibrand in March soon after she was appointed to the Senate by Gov. David
Paterson (D-N.Y).
The fundraiser is for Maloney*s House fund but in practical terms, the fundraiser has the same effect as raising
money for a Senate campaign. Maloney is allowed to transfer unlimited sums from her House campaign
account to any future Senate account, according to FEC law.
Clinton spokesman Matt McKenna said the fundraiser is part of a series of events where the former president is
helping out elected officials who supported his wife*s 2008 presidential campaign.
*We agreed to do this event some time ago, as a way of saying thank you for the congresswoman*s hard

Our first calling, in politics, is to protect, honor and leave better our American system...
If we tear down the American political process by doing and saying anything to win then we have failed that calling

The campaign cycle of 2010 has had a tumultuous start. Tea Party libertarians screaming from street corners, unhappy
workers taking on incumbents, disgruntled faithful praying that the administration will keep its promises, Birthers
repelling from black helicopters into the American mainstream and town hall meetings resembling Three Stooges re-

Subject: Saudi Grand Mufti calls attacks on foreign embassies un-islamic (Reuters)
RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Ara.bia's Grand Mufti, the highest religious authority in the birthplace of Islam, on
Saturday denounced attacks on diplomats and embassies as un-Islamic after deadly protests against a U.S.-made
film mocking Islam's founder.
Sheikh Abdulaziz bin Abdullah Al al-Sheikh also called on governments and international bodies to
criminalise insults against prophets and excoriated the film that has prompted a wave of fury across the Middle
East.
&quot;It is forbidden to punish the innocent for the wicked crimes of the guilty, or to attack those who have been
granted protection of their lives and property, or to expose public buildings to fire or destruction,&quot; he said in a
speech carried by state news agency SPA.
Describing the release of the crudely made short film as &quot;miserable&quot; and &quot;criminal&quot;, he added that attacks on
the innocent and diplomats &quot;are also a distortion of the Islamic religion and are not accepted by God&quot;.
At least nine people were killed after noon prayers on Friday in demonstrations across the Middle East.

Dear Secretary Clinton,
It is with great pride and a full heart that I write to thank you for your personal, videotaped message congratulating Gays
and Lesbians in Foreign Affairs Agencies (GLIFAA) on winning this year's &quot;Outie&quot; award for best LGBT employee resource
group by Out &amp; Equal Workplace Advocates . Your message and the significance carried in delivering it personally was
reflected in the silence that came over the audience of over 2,000 people when you began speaking and the furious
applause heard afterwards. While not the only GLIFAA member in attendance that night to receive the award, as the
only Foreign Service Officer there to witness the event, the award held special significance for me. Your message had
the greatest impact on everyone attending the Out &amp; Equal Summit this year, but as a direct beneficiary of your work I
was especially touched and awed.
It is you, Under Secretary Kennedy, and all the senior staff of the Department that truly deserve this honor. As an FSO
with a domestic partner, your efforts to bring equality to State have allowed me to stay in a career I love. Thank you for
all you are doing for the LGBT community, for the Foreign and Civil Service, and for the opportunity to attend such a

Ismail Haniyeh, addressing a rare news conference in the Israeli-blockaded enclave, signaled a softening of Hamas's
long-standing position prohibiting the ceding of any part of the land of what was British-mandated Palestine until 1948.

We will work with CA to have a letter prepared to take.
The case is typical in that the U.S. parent has custody that the Egyptian courts have not yet recognized (case is pending).
But it's atypical in that it's the mother who took the kids to Egypt and the father who is in the U.S. We're in touch with

created perhaps as many as 450,000 refugees, according to the U.N.—and on the eve of the June 27
constitutional referendum—he explains why and how this is an opportunity for joint U.S.-Russian action and
other U.S. initiatives. His policy recommendations follow his report.

    <body>Subject Previous CTO proposal
Madam Secretary,
Jake mentioned that you asked for more information about a proposal made in 2005 for a global CT organization, and he
asked me to find out a little about it. Below is some brief information on the proposal, which was made by Saudi Arabia:
The proposal made by the then crown prince (now king) in Feb. 2005 called for the establishment of an international
counterterrorism center &quot;under the auspices of the UN.&quot; The purpose of the organization would be to, among other
things, &quot;develop a mechanism for exchanging information and expertise between States&quot; on a wide range of non-
military counterterrorism issues, encourage the establishment of national and regional centers, and provide assistance
to developing countries to deal with crises and terrorist acts. The center, as conceived in 2005, would also allow national
counterterrorism coordinators from different countries and regions to meet and share information and experiences.
This proposal was endorsed by the OIC (and OIC countries reaffirm their support for the center each year at the UNGA),
but has never received any serious consideration within the UN by non-OIC members. The Saudis continue to be
interested in implementing the proposal. Most significantly, recently there have been discussions between the UN and
Saudis as to how their proposal could be married with efforts to enhance the UN's capacity to support implementation
of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy by allowing the UN Counter-Terrorism Task Force (CTITF) Office and the
different CTITF member entities to engage more actively and directly with CT experts/practitioners in capitals and have
multilateral CT consultations wherever necessary.
But S/CT mentioned that, if we were to move forward
on S/CT's CFO idea, we would hope to work closely with the Saudis.
Please let me know if you would like any further info.

In addition to the longer chain, you should know that the location of these units is very problematic and would
significantly change the demographic dynamics of the city and the ability to divide it, if we get to the point. Har Homa is
located in southern Jerusalem just north of Bethlehem. The B and C phases of Har Homa will expand the neighborhood
eastward (hotdog shape), going a long ways to cutting off Bethlehem for Jerusalem and the Arab neighborhoods there.

U.N. asks Afghanistan to lift election media ban
KABUL, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The United Nations has asked Afghanistan to lift a last-minute ban on media reporting of
violence during Thursday's presidential election, saying the Afghan constitution guaranteed a free press. Afghan
authorities imposed the ban on Tuesday with two decrees, the first barring journalists from reporting any violence in the
country between 6:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. (0130-1530 GMT) on polling day. The second ordered journalists to stay away
from the scenes of any attacks. The government says the measures are intended to prevent reports of violence from
scaring Afghans away from voting. Taliban fighters have vowed to disrupt the election.• The United Nations said Afghans
had a right to information, and restricting the media could undermine confidence in the poll. &quot;People need access to
information, not only on polling day but after polling day. The credibility of these elections is directly linked to the
information that they have access to,&quot; said Aleem Siddique, spokesman for the U.N. mission in Kabul. &quot;Its unclear to us
what if any legal basis there would be for such a directive when Afghanistan's constitution guarantees freedom of
expression and freedom of the press. We are making this point to the Afghan authorities,&quot; he said on Wednesday.

If our early assessment of today's election in Honduras holds, we will have just been witness to a remarkable thing:
Honduran voters have taken back their democracy from two failed leaders -- Zelaya and Micheletti -- who had driven
Honduras to isolation and despair.
The turnout (probably a record) and the clear rejection of the Liberal Party shows our approach was the right one, and
puts Brazil and others who would not recognize the election in an impossible position. As we think about what to say, I
would strongly recommend that we not be shy. We should congratulate the Honduran people, we should connect

Whenever you do something big on TV we all hear from lots of folks saying you did great. But this time is noticeably
different. First, people across the spectrum - DC insiders, reporters, staff, ex-staff, friends of friends, WH folks, etc -

I'm guessing and hoping you hear this directly from random folks in the coming days.
And I think because it's been a lousy couple of weeks for the Admin, with mixed messages and bad news, coupled with
many people seeing you for the first time for an extended period talking about the job and your relationship with the

Madame Secretary,
A shoot out occurred on August 20 in front of the American School in Monterrey (AFSM), resulting in the death of two
bodyguards. An investigation is continuing into the details, but our understanding at this point is that it was an
attempted kidnapping targeting the relatives of a local business executive. While it does not appear that U.S. families
were targeted, the sharp increase in kidnapping incidents in the Monterrey area, and this event in particular, present a
very high risk to the families of U.S. citizens who might be become incidental victims.
U.S. security and law enforcement personnel have engaged local and federal security officials to seek their help on
understanding the immediate risks and measures that can be taken. I have urged U.S. families at the Consulate in
Monterrey not to send their children to school in the coming days while we review the events that took place on August
20. We also are advising U.S. citizens in the area that we have urged Consulate personnel not to send their children to
school while we complete this security review.
I am sure that the warden notice will lead to a rash of press reports on U.S. concerns about security in Monterrey. More

Madam Secretary,
I know you are deeply concerned about reports of ongoing violence and attacks against women that have occurred in
Guinea-Conakry. I want to let you know what actions the Africa Bureau is taking to address this crisis.
I met with Guinean Foreign Minister Alexandre Cece Loua this morning at 9:00. I expressed our deep outrage at the
brutal actions of Guinean security forces against protesters on September 28, which resulted in 157 deaths, hundreds
more injured, and the widespread rape of women. I will separately provide you with a formal readout of the meeting. I
have also sent one of my Deputies, Bill Fitzgerald, to Conakry, where he met yesterday with President Dadis Camara and
expressed the same outrage.
We are pressing the government to take immediate actions to stop the violence and to restore constitutional order. We
have asked Dadis Camara to step aside and to seek exile in Morocco or another French-speaking country. We have also
asked Guinea to invite in observers from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to monitor the

Subject: Joint Interview
MS—
Jake just relayed your desire to cancel tomorrow's interview. But I want to make sure you are aware of a few things that
he was not in a position to share:
1) The Israeli &amp; Palestinian interviewers and their teams skipped returning home today with their principals at great
cost and energy in order to stay the extra day to you. One skipped traveling onward with Abbas.
2) Both the Israeli &amp; Palestinian media outlets involved immediately announced their joint interview and are hyping its
unprecedented nature
3) Because of #2, U.S. media is fully aware that this interview is scheduled for tomorrow morning.
So three points:
1) There is an incredibly high expectation for this interview occurring and canceling, no matter the reason cited, will be
taken to mean something negative2) The point of this interview was to shape the narrative coming out of today, and
canceling will only contribute to a negative narrative in that we will be canceling on the most important figure in Israeli
media, and I do not see Channel 2 taking that well3) As positive as the symbolism of this interview was meant to be,
we run the risk of the negative symbolism by canceling.
Typically when you want to cancel something I roll with it. But I want to strenuously object to doing so in this case. I
understand you told the participants they should refrain from public comment, but first, that doesn't mean you have to

about them during this interview. Not to mention that the reason for canceling is something we ourselves could have

Bill Clinton and Jean Max Bellerive to head the reconstruction committee
An Interim Committee for the Reconstruction of Haiti will be implemented in the coming days. It will be headed by former
U.S. President Bill Clinton and the current Prime Minister of Haiti Jean Max Bellerive.
This committee could be composed of 16 members including 9 foreigners. It should have the flexibility to make important
decisions in the context of rebuilding the country devastated by a powerful earthquake last January 12.

Subject: Freedom of Expression - UN Human Rights
Jake,
I wanted to update you on two aspects of our work leading up to the September session at the UN Human
Rights Council where the U.S. will be a full member for the first time: 1) freedom of expression (addressed in
this email) and 2) human rights strategy at the UN (in a second email on high side).
First, I'd like to let you know about the successful next step in a strategy we are pursuing at the UN Human
Rights Council to begin to change the dialogue on Freedom of Expression. We think we have developed a
well-balanced text that we can move forward to adoption in the UN HRC's September session. This work
contributes to our long-term effort to improve this UN body. Progress on this issue would help us later as we
address the even more difficult issue of the &quot;defamation of religions&quot; about which the Secretary expressed
interest in a Monday senior staff meeting.
An 10-DRL-L-NEA group has been working together to implement the strategy that involves reaching
agreement with the Egyptians on a text that we will roll out late next week with countries in the OIC
(Organization of the Islamic Conference) and the WEOG (Western European and Other Group, our regional
group at the UN).
Experts in L, DRL, 10, and NEA agree that the text protects all USG red lines and offers us a workable
compromise that can secure genuine cross-regional consensus when presented in the Human Rights Council in

Subject: Tony Blair on the American Ideal
Americans can be all that the rest of the world sometimes accuses them of: brash, loud, insular, obsessive and heavy-
handed. But America is great for a reason. It is looked up to, despite all the criticism, for a reason. There is a nobility in
the American character that has been developed over the centuries, derived in part, no doubt, from the frontier spirit,
from the waves of migration that form the stock, from the circumstances of independence, from the Civil War, from a
myriad of historical facts and coincidences. But it is there.
That nobility isn't about being nicer, better or more successful than anyone else. It is a feeling about the country. It is a
devotion to the American ideal that at a certain point transcends class, race, religion or upbringing. That ideal is about
values: freedom, the rule of law, democracy. It is also about the way you achieve: on merit, by your own efforts and
hard work. But it is most of all that in striving for and protecting that ideal, you as an individual take second place to the
interests of the nation as a whole. It is what makes the country determined to overcome its challenges. It is what makes
its soldiers give their lives in sacrifice. It is what brings every variety of American, from the lowest to the highest, to their
feet when &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; is played. Of course the ideal is not always met — that is obvious. But it is always
striven for.
The Need for American Confidence
The next years will test the American character. America won't be loved in this presidency any more than in previous
ones. But America should have confidence. That ideal, which produces the optimism that generates the achievement, is
worth all the striving. It is the most precious gift a nation can have. The world is changing. New powers are emerging.
But this does not diminish the need for that American ideal. It reaffirms it, renews it, gives it added relevance. There is
always one, more prosaic, test of a nation's position: Are people trying to get into it, or to get out of it? I think we know
the answer to that in America's case, and that ideal is the reason.
A friend of mine whose parents were immigrants, Jews from Europe who came to America in search of safety, told me
this story. His parents lived and worked in New York. They were not well off. His father died when he was young. His
mother lived on, and in time my friend succeeded and became wealthy. He often used to offer his mother the chance to
travel outside America. She never did. When eventually she died, they went back to recover the safety box where she
kept her jewelry. They found there was another box. There was no key. So they had to drill it open. They wondered what

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Taliban insurgents had planned to use five Americans, now detained in Pakistan, who had
contacted the militants via the Internet, to carry out attacks in the U.S.-allied country, a police official said. Usman
Anwar, police chief in Sargodha, where the men were arrested this month, said emails had revealed plans for the young
men from Virginia to travel to a Pakistani nuclear power plant. &quot;We believe that they were supposed to be used inside
Pakistan,&quot; Anwar told Reuters by telephone. &quot;In their last email to the Taliban, we found they mentioned the Chashma

support of Law of Sea and likely sympathy for New START will be good for us. Reid will likely return to
Washington energized by win to pursue consequential lame duck session. Manchin and Kirk will take up their
seats in the Senate this month; Rich suggests S calls to each to help lock in support for New START.
Other Congressional issues
Tom Nides' prep going well, and he'll see SFRC members and Sem Gilibrand this week. Rich expects

has shined a spotlight on eastern Congo, opening a significant window for policy reform.
&quot;The new U.S. law on conflict minerals and the growing global campaign have shaken up
the supply chain, and all those that are profiting say they are willing to change,&quot; says
Prendergast. &quot;It is time for the U.S. government and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to
help leverage the end of the war in eastern Congo through leadership on two of the issues
that will catalyze a broader solution to the cycles of violence there: minerals certification
and comprehensive army reform.&quot;

    <body>REVAVA (AP) - Dozens of Jewish settlers broke ground on a new daycare center deep inside the West Bank to celebrate
the end of the government's 10-month-old construction slowdown at midnight- symbolically renewing settlement
activity that threatens to derail peace talks with the Palestinians. Some 2000 people headed to another nearby
settlement for a larger rally, where activists released 2000 blue and white balloons- the colors of the Israeli flag- into the

All:
Ops has provided below the latest Stevens update on Benghazi:
• Traffkaccidenti Police have accepted the USG version of the story: that it was an accident and the
victims were not wearing seathelts. The USG employees were returning from the airport when the
incident occurred. A total of four people died and six injured. USG employee Mjuries are light if any.
Our people are standing by pending official USG instructions. Stevens notes there is a UK flight
tomorrow they could be on if necessary. The TNC wants to do a press release to quell the rumor mill.
Stevens will send the draft back to Department for L and PA clearance.
• The British envoy departs tomorrow on permanent change of station. There will be a gap before his
replacement, John Jenkins, arrives from Baghdad.
• INC head Malunoud fibril will be going to Jordan and will not be back in Benghazi until Friday. The
development is likely to he met with additional criticism that he is spending too much time abroad at the
expense of other government affairs.

Right after the call, the MEA sought to clarify a key point, which moderates Krishna's message. According to
the GOI, the Ministry wants to underline that while the Minister had conveyed to the Secretary India's &quot;broad
political support&quot; for the Copenhagen Accord, it was not yet ready to be &quot;listed&quot; as a party to the Accord. But
the GOI also understands that the listing process is a priority matter.

Cheryl, I can't imagine what this week has been like for you but wanted to write after attending the Andrews ceremony
today. I was with some NEA hands who knew Chris well and they all noted the Secretary's visit to their offices earlier in
the week and how pitch-perfect this has been handled. The remarks today were beautiful and moving. I did not have a
personal connection to the four lost this week but the President and Secretary seemed to be speaking as well to those I
did know and still mourn. So I wanted to write to say thank you. This is among the most challenging and uncertain
periods in our history — and our nation is more fortunate than it knows to have such a steady team at the helm,

Palestinian Authority negotiator in peace talks with Israel, said he expected the resolution would be put to a
UNSC vote in February, after the United States ends its presidency of the council. &quot;We are not condemning
Israel. We are condemning settlement activities and we hope the resolution will pass,&quot; Erekat said. He said 15

I want to meet w people Thursday night so pls don't schedule anything after Capricia's event.
On Friday, can Kessler be moved to next week?
Rahm told me there may be a small mtg w the POTUS on Sunday morning so I may need to take plane back either late
Sat night or early Sun am. Also Rahm said he wanted to see me alone sometime before that Sunday mtg. Pls follow up
on both mtgs.
If there is a Sunday am mtg w POTUS, I will also try to go to the Ling lunch.

The expression &quot;do more&quot; repeated incessantly in today's press is essentially a negative characterization of the

the Americans are telling us we're still not doing enough.&quot; This negative interpretation is used by the PakMil to convince
Pakistanis that the U.S. is a malign influence and to avoid taking the steps we seek.

Here's the update, pieced together from various sources:
Starting at around 3 pm Friday, Adams and McGuinness returned to Hillsborogh to meet with Robinson and Arlene
Foster. The four talked privately for several hours and then asked for the draft papers to review. The discussion
continued until around 1 am when the parties left Hillsborough. (Foster's presence is apparently very helpful. Her
relationship with the SF leaders is much more positive and direct, treating them as equal colleagues.)
Woodward and Irish FM Martin will meet with Adams and Robinson separately this afternoon to assess where the talks
are. The talks last night/early morning ended more positively and if that is still the case there may be a decision to push
on today to see if agreement can be reached. It is equally possible that the two ministers and DUP/SF will decide to
wind up today and resume on Monday.
Brown and Cowen have spoken this morning and will speak again late this afternoon.
The issue is still parades. Robinson needs some certainity of change on parades. It is important for him politically within
the DUP, but also externally since this has become a symbol of whether he has achieved something or compromised too
much. Adams and SF have moved very far from their original positions on parades, adding that Robinson has also

I'm having a little reception on 3/22 6pm over at the OAS to celebrate my swearing-in. I'd love it if you could come by

I'd love to invite the Secretary. Is that even proper protocol? Although she probably couldn't attend, I'd like to share it

Gordon Brown called Lou Susman a short while ago. Brown believes you should make a call to McGuinness this morning
around 830 am (DecIan and I agree that if you call McG you also must call Robinson). Brown proposes to speak with you
at 820 or so to bring you up to speed before those calls.
The current situation is that Brown and Cowen are in Belfast, and met with Robinson, McGuinness, and other parties
until 330 in the morning Belfast time. They have now resumed today. The sticking point is parades. Robinson wants the
current parades commission abolished because it gives Republicans too much say. McGuinness refuses to allow the
parades issue to be tied to the devolution issue.

don't know if movie producers are still worthy in your world, but next time you're in NYC I'd love to see you.
I have such fond memories of you guys watching SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE. I made another movie you might like about the
ascendancy of King George after Edward abdicated, it's called KINGS SPEECH. The movie brings to light something that
many people don't know, which is that King George was a stutterer and he hired an actor to try and help him overcome
it. It's a fun movie that is much in the tradition of SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, again I think you would both like it (and
Hillary would approve because it's PG-13 with not too many swear words).

This Administration has, from the beginning, worked to bring about comprehensive peace in the Middle East, including a
two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. On that issue our approach has been three-fold: (1) to help build the
economy and capacity to govern of a Palestinian state; (2) to renew political negotiations to enable the earliest possible
establishment of that state; and (3) to achieve these in a manner that ensures the security of Israel and of the

(Jerusalem Post) Prime Minister Netanyahu met with Likud MKs and deputy ministers to discuss the U.S.
proposal for a 90-day construction freeze, November 21. In the meeting, Netanyahu told the Likud officials: &quot;I
have a responsibility that includes making the best decision for the state of Israel and its national interests,
foremost, its security.&quot; He continued, 'We still haven't received the written agreement from the Americans on
the basic understandings.&quot; The prime minister assured those attending the meeting, &quot;If we receive a written
agreement, I will bring it to the cabinet and I am sure that the ministers will approve it because it is what's best
for the state of Israel.&quot; He added, &quot;If we don't receive such a document, I won't bring the issue [of a freeze] to
the cabinet.&quot;
Earlier in the day thousands of settlers protested outside the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem against the
potential freeze. National Infrastructures Minister Uzi Landau, an opponent of an additional freeze, addressed
the demonstrators. Dozens of youngsters also blocked the entrance to Jerusalem. Police dispersed the
protesters and arrested two people. Over the weekend, Kadima MK Avi Dichter told The Jerusalem Post, &quot;The

    <body>Hi Huma — could you please show this to the Secretary? Senator Reid's staff and Senator
Lautenberg would like the letter below sent to his office today. Upon receipt of the letter, we are
told Senator Lautenberg will lift his hold on the GSP and ATPDA trade legislation. I know the
Secretary would prefer to wait until there is a final decision in Brazil, but it is still unclear when
that decision will come (may not even be today) and we have drafted the letter so that it still makes
sense regardless of how and when the court rules. Thanks, and I'm at my desk if she wants to
discuss it further. Rich
Dear Senator Lautenberg,
I appreciated the opportunity to speak with you this past weekend regarding the custody case of
Sean Goldman, the young American boy wrongfully detained in Brazil for more than five
years. As we discussed, the Administration has long maintained that Sean should be reunited with
his father David in New Jersey. I have made a point of emphasizing this position with Brazilian
Foreign Minister Celso Amorim during our many conversations, as have other U.S. Officials with
their Brazilian counterparts.
We have worked closely with the Government of Brazil to ensure it upholds its obligations under
the Hague Convention on International Child Abduction. We were quite concerned by last week's
decision suspending the order reuniting Sean with his father. We were encouraged, however, by
the appeal filed last Friday by the Brazilian Solicitor General which challenges this
suspension. Like you, we are eager to learn of the outcome of this appeal. We understand a
decision could be announced shortly.

Subject: AMCIT suspected of abuse of minors in Liberia
Cheryl: My staff assistance received a call from the &quot;Line&quot; saying you might want a short informal note to send to the
Secretary on the situation with the American UNMIL employee suspected of abusing minors in Liberia. Below is a
shorter and updated version of what I sent you earlier. I will be on leave for a week beginning tomorrow and one my
deputies, Bill Fitzgerald, will be following this issue in my absence. Regards, Johnnie
An American citizen civilian employee of the UN operation in Liberia is suspected of engaging in illegal acts with at least
two underage Liberian girls. The Liberian National Police, who received a DVD of the acts, told Embassy officials earlier
today they had identified the American citizen and confirmed the identity of two girls—an 11-year-old and another
between 12-15 years of age. These are crimes in Liberia as well as in the United States.
We are working with Liberian authorities and the UN to ensure that the American citizen is made to answer for these
allegations. In the meantime, the Department is working with Department of Justice lawyers to determine if the
American citizen can be tried in the United States. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, currently in the Department
chairing a promotion panel, has spoken to President Johnson-Sirleaf about the importance of this case. It appears that
the UN will waive any immunity the American may have and that the Liberians will take the American citizen into

I am seeking more information about this but want to let you know before the 5pm call that 10 Amcits were reportedly
arrested by Haitian police near the DR border with 33 Haitian children whom they reportedly planned to take to an
orphanage they are establishing in the DR. They are currently under arrest at a PAP police station or, according to one
report, at &quot;the Justice Building near the airport.&quot; The whereabouts of the children is unknown.
The group is called the New Life Children Refuge America Organization (NLCR). Bill Bistransky found the attached &quot;Plan

into Haiti to get children, or their original schedule is off.

A new Buffalo Bill is catching the world's attention.
On the practice field Tuesday afternoon, he was just another Bill, a rookie no less, but he's
catching a lot of attention in his family's homeland.
In China this week, during a speech to dignitaries at the USA Pavilion, Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton said this:
&quot;From Yo-Yo Ma to I.M. Pei to Commerce Secretary Gary Locke and Energy Secretary Chu,
Chinese-Americans have achieved great success in business, government, the arts, sciences and
sports. And to that end, I was pleased to hear that the Buffalo Bills have recently drafted the
first Chinese-American to play in the NFL,&quot; said Clinton.
Buffalo Bills offensive tackle Ed Wang said, &quot;It felt good. She's a very important person, and so
for someone like that to talk about me, it just feels good.&quot;
Wang didn't know until he heard from News 4 that he was mentioned in Shanghai. The 6'5&quot;, 250

    <body>WASHINGTON (CNN) — Fewer than three in 10 Americans think Sarah Palin's qualified to be president, according to a
new national poll - the least of any of the five potential candidates included in the survey.
But another woman tops that list in the CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Monday: two-thirds of the
public thinks that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's qualified for the Oval Office. That's more than Vice President Joe
Biden, who's currently next in line for the presidency.
According to the poll, 28 percent of Americans say Palin is qualified to run the White House, with seven in 10 saying the
former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee is not qualified.
The survey indicates that a majority of Republicans, 54 percent, feel Palin is qualified, with 44 percent indicating she
isn't. But only 29 percent of independent voters questioned feel she is qualified to serve as president, with 68 percent
disagreeing. According to the poll, nine in 10 Democrats feel Palin is not qualified.
The poll's release comes one day before the release of Palin's book, &quot;Going Rogue: An American Life.&quot;
&quot;The perception that Palin is not qualified to be president puts her significantly behind two potential rivals for the GOP
nomination in 2012 - Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee,&quot; says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.
According to the survey, nearly half of all Americans think Romney is qualified to be president, with 43 percent feeling
the same way about Huckabee. Among Republicans, Palin is still lagging other potential 2012 primary candidates: 63
percent of GOPers think that Romney and Huckabee are qualified, 9 points higher than the number that say the same of
Palin.&quot;
Palin has many strengths - recent CNN polls indicate that Americans believe that she is not a typical politician, that she
cares about average Americans, and that she is honest and trustworthy,&quot; says Holland. &quot;But the perception that she is
not qualified for the White House is her biggest Achilles heel.&quot;An ABC News/Washington Post poll also released Monday
indicates that 38 percent of Americans say Palin's qualified to serve as president, with six in 10 saying she's not qualified.
The CNN survey indicates that 67 percent of people questioned say that Clinton is qualified to serve in the Oval Office,
17 points higher than the 50 percent of Americans who think that Biden's qualified to take over as president.Biden's low
number may be attributable to negative feelings about the Obama/Biden administration rather than views of Biden
personally.&quot;
In the past, poll respondents who dislike an administration have sometimes taken it out on the vice president,&quot; say
Holland. Polls from the late 1990s showed that Americans felt Al Gore was qualified to be president, but only if
respondents were given the chance to say something negative about Gore that was unrelated to his qualifications, he
adds. In the Bush administration, the number who thought Dick Cheney was qualified to be president dropped as the
administration grew more unpopular. &quot;Cheney's experience in office didn't change during that period - attitudes toward
the Bush/Cheney administration did,&quot; he says.
Hillary Clinton also has the advantage of having been able to stay out of domestic policy debates, including health care,
the economic stimulus, and other controversial matters, while adding almost daily to her experience in foreign policy,

Kyrgyzstan will not reverse its decision to close a U.S. military air base which is used to supply American troops for
Afghanistan occupation, Kyrgyz Foreign Minister Kadyrbek Sarbayev said on Thursday. U.S. President Barack Obama has

But Bakiyev's office said in a statement it had received a letter from Obama praising bilateral relations. &quot;Moreover,
Barack Obama expressed hope to further strengthen various forms of cooperation between the United States and
Kyrgyzstan,&quot; the statement said without mentioning the air base issue. &quot;The decision to annul all agreements on the
Manas military air base has been taken and there is no turning back on this,&quot; he told the 24.kg news agency.

The Post's Dec 27 editorial (&quot;Redefining Human Rights&quot;) on the Obama Administration's human rights and democracy
policies, and Secretary Clinton's recent speech at Georgetown in particular, misses THE CRITICAL
POINT: human rights, democracy, and development are mutually reinforcing, not competing goals. They complement
each other in the [DELETE: practical] task of making human rights a human reality.
President Roosevelt understood the fundamental link between liberty, prosperity and security, tying together freedom
of speech and worship with freedom from want and freedom from fear in his famous &quot;Four Freedoms&quot;
speech. At Georgetown, Secretary Clinton articulated a 21st century vision grounded in this [DELETE: old] wisdom.
To accuse Secretary Clinton of embracing a Soviet-bloc approach to human rights because she includes development in a
discussion of democracy not only strains the bonds of credulity and common sense, it also walls off a crucial avenue for
ensuring that people can actually exercise the rights that are naturally theirs - including the rights to freedom of religion,
association, and speech-in their daily lives.
AS SECRETARY CLINTON MADE CLEAR, policies that address development alone are not adequate: &quot;Freedom doesn't
come in half measures, and partial remedies will not solve the whole problem,&quot; she said. But experience shows us that
where broad-based development occurs, people are more likely to demand a say in securing their futures, and
governments are more likely to have the resources to maintain the strong institutions, including reliable police and fair
courts, that help ensure the consistent protection of rights. Where people are given the right to speak freely, to
participate in their nation's political process and have access to basic information about government, sustainable
development is [DELETE: much] more likely to occur. At the same time, democracies without development do not last.
These are mutually reinforcing tracks, and the Obama Administration is committed to pursuing both simultaneously.
As President Obama said in his Nobel lecure, &quot;engagement with repressive regimes lacks the satisfying purity of
indignation.&quot; But the Post's overheated outrage ignores the [DELETE: practical] lessons learned by generations of men
and women who worked to advance human rights around the world.

Dear Sen. Klobuchar,
Thank you for taking the time to send this message; you can be sure it will be read by many people. We know that we
touch lives in the course of our work, sometimes during moments of unimaginable anguish, nearly always at a time of
tremendous stress and worry. It is a privilege to be in a position to help. We never forget that the spirit and heart with
which we respond to citizens in trouble matter as much as the actions we take.
We are all celebrating the safe travel to the U.S. of these six little children, and the hundreds of others we've been able
to assist under the orphan humanitarian parole program. Thank you very much for your great work and for the valuable
information you kept sending us throughout the past few days.
Sincerely, Michele Bond

Will do. This is such a critical (and frustrating) issue that I want to try and start moving forward on it as soon as we can. I
know Raj wants to address this as well. I'd like to start off with a relatively small group of DoS and USAID reps, plus a
group top private sector brand and other ex erts. For exam .l

H: More trouble for Tories and Cameron. He needs to support NI peace, not another

March 5, 2010
New blow for Tories as lead slips in marginals
By Nigel Morris and Michael Savage
Poll shows crumbling support in target seats as David
Cameron is drawn into Ashcroft non-dom row
The Conservative lead is crumbling in the crucial marginal seats that David Cameron is relying on to deliver general
election victory for the party, a poll last night disclosed.
The result was a fresh setback for the Tory leader after a torrid day in which he was drawn deeper into the row over the
billionaire peer Lord Ashcroft, when it emerged that he had known for less than a month that Lord Ashcroft had
maintained his non-dom tax status for 10 years.
The chances of the party drawing a line under the controversy were also wrecked by the announcement that Lord
Ashcroft will be summoned to the Commons to explain why he negotiated a secret deal to enter the House of Lords
without paying tax in this country on his overseas fortune.
With Gordon Brown expected to announce the election date this month, senior Tories have put a brave face on their
sliding support in national opinion polls since the turn of the year.
They insisted they were performing much more strongly in marginal constituencies where the drive for votes has been
masterminded and substantially funded by Lord Ashcroft.
The YouGov poll for Channel 4 News found the Tory lead in 60 Labour-held marginals had shrunk from seven to just two
points over the past year.
The slide in Conservative support is further evidence Britain could be heading for a hung parliament after the election
expected on 6 May. The survey put the Tories on 39 per cent (down four points since last year) and Labour on 37 per cent
(up one). YouGov calculated that the results would leave the Tories the largest party after the election, but 11 seats short
of an overall Commons majority.
An investigation by The Independent last week found the Tories spent £6m over two years in the marginal battlegrounds,
in most cases far outspending Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
The party faces the daunting challenge of capturing 117 seats to achieve a majority of just one - a task described by a
shadow cabinet member as a &quot;mountain to climb&quot;.

You may already be aware of this, but in the event you aren't: A Spanish helicopter based on their Navy ship &quot;Castilla&quot;
disappeared in a mountainous region near the Dominican border shortly before noon. The Spanish Embassy called us,
and JTF scrambled a helo. Chilean MINUSTAH helo had also been dispatched. The Spanish helo apparently crashed and
burned in an area where rescue helos could not land, so a JTF helo landed in the closest area and US troops with
stretchers hiked in. On arrival, they reported that the crew of four had all been killed. We are getting body bags into
the site now and will remove the bodies today. This is the first fatality involving foreign troops engaged in earthquake

The political timing on the EU presidency is accelerating. Sarkozy and Merkel are meeting tonight (October 18)

November 3. Shortly after, perhaps that week, before you meet with Merkel on November 8-9, there may be an
EU Council meeting to decide the matter. So you may want to weigh in before then.

Subject: Palau offended by US positions
Below is the statement of very impressive Palau reps at the end of a session of required meetings on the next phase of
free association aid. FYI only, the Palauans were insulted by the nature and depth of the response to their proposal as
well as the content and the overall approach. They are even privately questioning the relationship. (This hasn't affected
their intent to take the Uighurs.) I will send a few further thoughts.
At the conclusion of yesterday's meeting, the Palau delegation caucused to discuss its reaction to the response of the
United States delegation to the proposals that it made in June in Washington D.C., and expanded upon in subsequent
communications.
While the Palau delegation has agreed to respond to certain additional questions raised by the United States delegation
on specific elements of the Palau proposal, and further has agreed to participate in certain working groups on specific
issues, the Palau delegation was deeply disappointed with the response of the United States delegation. The United
States delegation did not seriously respond, as required by the Compact, to the operational requirements of the
Government of Palau or to Palau's comprehensive and considered plans to achieve economic advancement and self-
sufficiency.
In light of the foregoing, the Palau delegation has determined that it must now return to Palau to discuss with President
Toribiong the next steps that Palau needs to take regarding the Compact. Thank you. .

Re: British election
First and most important: Do NOT, repeat, NOT, call any prospective winner on either Election Night, May 6, or on the
next day, Friday, May 7. The result will be unclear. It will not be clear, even perhaps by Friday afternoon. Today, the
combined polls show Cameron and the Conservatives ahead but not winning an outright majority. The latest Guardian
poll, out tomorrow, shown me by Alan Rusbridger today, has the Tories falling short of a majority of seats. Even if
Cameron were to win an outright majority, Brown and Labour will attempt to make a deal with Clegg and the Liberal
Democrats. Brown remains as Prime Minister unless the Tories win outright, which take a long time to determine.
Labour and the Lib-Dems will almost certainly gain about 60 percent of the vote, more or less. Brown will reach out to
Clegg to stay in power. The deal will be that Brown will approve a referendum on proportional representation giving the
LDs much greater representationin future elections. That will spell the end forever of the Tories ever coming to power.
The Tories see the election in apocalyptic terms—and they are not wrong. Brown's weakness heralds the sort of grand
progressive coalition/alliance that Tony imagined but was never able to attempt between Labour and the LDs. Brown
offering the referendum would be the first step toward that. In the case of the Tories falling short of an outright majority
in seats, they will respond as though Brown is acting illegitimately, which he would not be by remaining as PM and
dealing with Clegg. Informed people are already talking of what might begin to unfold on Friday as &quot;Florida.&quot; The Tories,
backed by the Murdoch press, will attempt to push Labour aside by force majeure—something that will not succeed
under those circumstances. The Murdochs are almost literally going crazy. James Murdoch and hiw wife stormed into
the offices of The Independent, not a Murdoch paper, when the paper endorsed the LDs and confronted the publisher,

Cheryl,
I just spoke with Vidal Jorgensen. They expect to be on the ground in about 8 months. They have not yet raised enough
money to get the project started—the total needed is $6M and they need $2M to get started. Vidal said they process
has been delayed because their work in Colombia and China is consuming all their resources at the moment. Once on
the ground, they will target the poorest of the poor and go to the toughest areas of Haiti. They anticipate an average
loan size of $200 and they expect to reach about 10,000 borrowers in five years. They expect to be profitable in 4-5

From: Polley, Mary E

Subject: (Reuters) China says Britain sowing discord in climate politics
BEIJING - China condemned claims ascribed to Britain's climate change minister that it had &quot;hijacked&quot; negotiations in
Copenhagen, saying on Tuesday the accusations were an attempt to sow discord among poor countries.
The sharp words from Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu were the latest baring of diplomatic bad blood
after the talks in Copenhagen ended on Saturday with a broad, non-binding accord that fell short of hopes for a robust
global agreement on how to curb greenhouse gas emissions.
Jiang was responding to a report in Britain's Guardian newspaper that said the Environment Minister Ed Miliband had
accused China, Sudan, Bolivia and other left-wing Latin American nations of &quot;hijacking&quot; efforts to reach deeper
agreement on how to fight global warming.
In a separate commentary for the paper, Miliband said China vetoed a widely supported proposal at the Copenhagen
talks to aim to cut global greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050.
&quot;We cannot again allow negotiations on real points of substance to be hijacked,&quot; he also wrote, but without singling out
China or any other country as a &quot;hijacker.&quot;
Chinese spokeswoman Jiang did not chide Miliband by name, but Beijing's ire was clear.
&quot;The statements from certain British politicians are plainly a political scheme,&quot; she said in a statement issued by the
official Xinhua news agency.
&quot;Their objective is to shirk responsibilities that should be assumed towards developing countries, and to provoke discord
among developing countries. This scheme will come to nothing.&quot;
The flap is unlikely to seriously disrupt negotiations seeking to turn the Copenhagen accord into a legally binding treaty.
But the sour exchange has underscored the distrust between China and rich countries that could frustrate efforts to
agree on that treaty by late 2010.
&quot;Everyone is raising the banner of protecting the planet, but in reality they are protecting their own interests,&quot; Wang Vi,
a climate change policy researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, told Reuters.
&quot;The compromises (in Copenhagen) were very, very limited.&quot;
China is the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases from human activities and its biggest developing economy.
Other governments have pressed it to do more to reduce its growing emissions and to submit its emissions goals to
international checks as part of any new climate pact.
But China and other big developing countries have accused the rich economies of failing to offer big enough cuts to their
emissions, and of not offering enough money and technological help to poor countries to cope with climate change.

Subject: Re: Thanks so much for the talk
Dear Hillary,
Spoke to the person you recommended on Friday. Sounds like he is comfortable and even surprised that Pakistanis are
doing more. And maybe he will find some more ways to help, like the helicopter leasing. When I mentioned that
someone deep in the ISI must be happy that Al Qaeda's alive, so we don't abandon Pakistan again, he chuckled.
I talked about the &quot;vetting&quot; for intelligence. I also talked &quot;defeat strategy,&quot; and the need for something more than just
deploying more forces and hoping the training for the Afghans will work.
I continue to be struck by the parallels to Vietnam, and especially Johnson's inability to resist escalation, and his
advisor's continued &quot;incrementalism.&quot;
But I'm encouraged by the pace of the review. Seems that there's sufficient time to consider this from all angles.
I can imagine there are those arguing that we just need to fill the gap while we enlarge the Afghan army. That we help
the Pakistanis but not press them to the point of being unpleasant. And that too much focus on Osama and al-Zawahiri
raises the risk of public failure if we don't get them. There is much logic to this, but it has a strong tint of incrementalism.
Hopefully, we can be more decisive: lean harder on the Pakistanis, provide more troops to McChrystal than his
&quot;moderate risk&quot; and raise the heat on al Qaeda - then do all we can to push economic development in Afghanistan,
restrain Indian meddling, and prepare to do more against Al Qaeda in Pakistan, directly if necessary. Ultimately, it
seems that our best exit strategy would be to take down the top leadership of Al Qaeda in Pakistan, and then gradually
draw down in Afghanistan.
Wish I could do more to help
All the best,
Wes

Very shortly after arriving at the site I believe the families understood the magnitude of the devastation at the Hote

They thanked the Ambassador and Rescue teams, Consulate, etc who were Searching for their loved ones.
Given the sad situation - the families were greatful to speak with people who were searching for their children.

First-Ever NHL-CHL Exhibition Game Helps Break International Ice in St. Petersburg: Thanks to U/S
Judith McHale who brought National Hockey League VP Ken Yaffe to Moscow under the auspices of the U.S.-
Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission for an icebreaker with Continental Hockey League representatives, St.
Petersburg's beloved SKA hockey team hosted the Carolina Hurricanes for an exhilarating exhibition game at
the Ice Palace. From the opening ceremony featuring both the U.S. and Russian national anthems, the capacity
crowd of 4,500 — including St. Petersburg Governor Valentina Matviyenko, SKA owner and Gazprom
Chairman Alexey Miller, Hurricanes owner and Compuware Corporation CEO Peter Karmanos, Jr., and U.S.
Consul General Sheila Gwaltney — cheered the two teams on. The heart-pounding, high-scoring game included
dazzling play by the 'Canes Eric Staal and Jeff Skinner (Carolina's game MVP) plus SKA favorites Alexei
Yashin (SKA's game MVP) and Maksim Sushinski. With Rossiya TV announcing that &quot;we've waited 20 years
for this,&quot; SKA broke the second period tie and led their team to a 5-3 victory over the 'Canes in the last
period. SKA's enthusiastic organ player rocked the crowd with themes from &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and &quot;The Addams
Family&quot; — plus Tina Turner's &quot;Simply the Best&quot; — and helped the Russian crowd give their home team their
traditional electrifying support. Continuing the &quot;sports diplomacy&quot; after the game, dozens of avid Russian
hockey fans waited patiently by the team buses and were elated when 'Canes Goalie Cam Ward signed
autographs and posed for photographs with them. The Russian crowd's enthusiasm for this match as well as
their admiration for the American team were ice-crystal clear from the capacity crowd (the stadium only sells
out for championship matches or games against their arch rival Moscow team), their cheers for the Hurricanes,
plus the extensive media presence, including live nation-wide coverage on Rossiya TV.

Re: Iran, Saudi
Had dinner last night (Tuesday, February 16) with Joschka Fischer. We had an interesting conversation on Iran
and Saudi Arabia, among other things. (As you know Fischer is now director of the Nabucco pipeline project.)
On Iran, harsh, targeted sanctions are absolutely necessary, but are most effective diplomatically when always
coupled with an offer to negotiate. The iron fist in the velvet glove approach achieves several objectives:
According to Fischer's intelligence, Ahmanijehad wished some negotiated settlement but was blocked. The
regime has splits at the top. Perhaps true, perhaps not. But constantly pushing negotiations alongside sanctions
puts additional pressure on internal divisions, whatever they are. Extending an open hand while brandishing a
stick closes diplomatic and political room to maneuver for Iran: Its refusal to accept the open hand justifies
application of the stick. Even when sanctions are enforced it always remains useful to say another way is open.
The damage done to Iran is therefore the result of its own choice. This approach also aids the opposition. A
purely condign sanctions strategy can contribute to the regime's will to punish and tighten repression. Talking

Beihl called me from the plane just before departure. De facto negotiating team will return to DC Wednesday for
several days talks. While ministers were discouraged by de factor regime intransigence, Beihl said that Zelaya had also
lost some support. He said that all the ministers were shocked by Zelaya's behavior in a telephone conference call just
before their press conference this afternoon. Zelaya spoke of people dying by hundreds, being thrown in jail and
tortured. Zelaya appeared to be very out-of-touch, Beihl said. He added that &quot;even&quot; the Argentine FM was questioning
whether Z's return was the correct course. Beihl said that while a democratic solution was needed, perhaps Zelaya was
not the right option. I again expressed our position that the problem was not who replaced Zelaya, but that he was
removed unconstitutionally.

I heard a wonderful story last night praising Hillary Clinton for her work on behalf of children.
Last night I met Don Graves, he runs the Independent Living Skills Program (ILSP) in Contra Costa
County. The program helps children in the foster care system, and among other things, teaches them
skills needed to live on their own as adults.
Don told a heart-warming story of how then First Lady Hillary Clinton came out to visit with the kids in the
program and hear their concerns. A major concern was that resources for kids coming out of foster care
ended at age 18 and 6 months -- they needed more help. Within two years of the visit, President Clinton
signed the Foster Care Independence Act, providing more money and more resources for ages 18 - 21. I

First, see below on Nagorno-Karabakh.
Third, on QME, Gates and Barak are meeting the week of UNGA and we are holding until then if you are comfortable
with that.
Fourth, Declan Kelly is going to be in Belfast Monday and Tuesday with Lou Susman. I will be there Tuesday for all of the
official meetings. Declan and I will stay Tuesday night after Lou leaves and have dinner with a broad cross-section of
folks.
Fifth, I'm working with Holbrooke's and Lew's shops on the materials for Af/Pak, and we'll have a concept paper over
the weekend on the UNGA curtain raiser.
Sixth, Mike Fuchs and I met with Team WHA on Mexico, following up on Carlos' memo. Mike is working with WHA to
ensure that we create a productive agenda and outcomes for the Merida meeting you will participate in at UNGA.
(SBU) Reports about an alleged lethal incident along the line of contact in Nagorno-Karabakh remain
unconfirmed. The potential implications on the peace process are not yet clear. At the moment, regional
leaders are responding cautiously and the impact on other regional processes does not appear
significant. The Armenian Ministry of Defense denied any unusual activity along the line of contact; the
Azerbaijan Ministry of Defense told media that incidents are frequent along the line of contact. Embassy
Yerevan reports that it is customary to deny reports of sniper incidents along the line of contact, but that an
incident of this magnitude would be difficult to cover up. Embassy Baku notes that President Aliyev is in
Kazakhstan and local authorities could be waiting for his return before deciding on how to proceed. Neither of
our Embassies have been able to confirm local media reports.

Madam Secretary,
The outpouring of condolences from the international community and the Afghans for Richard's passing has been
extraordinary. We have had a steady flow of visitors from the NATO and diplomatic community and, most importantly,
Afghans of every walk of life for several days who have come to sign the condolence book.
Today, during my weekly meeting with President Karzai, I took along the condolence book to be signed at the
Palace. President Karzai signed and wrote a nice tribute to Richard and graciously allowed us to bring an Embassy
photographer to memorialize the occasion. A photograph is attached. We will separately arrange for a copy to be
signed by President Karzai for Kati.
Separately, I would ask that you thank Mike Mullen for permitting the USO show with which he is traveling to stage an
unprecedented performance at the U.S. Embassy today. Allowing Embassy Kabul to be the site of a USO show in
Afghanistan was very gracious of Mike as normally USO shows are only held at military bases. We had an extraordinary

Still working this through, but here is where we are thus far:
The majority of all countries that have direct presidential elections use a Two-Round system. The number appears to be
at least 58.
France, most Latin American countries, all five post-Soviet Central Asian republics, and many countries in francophone
Africa use TRS to elect their presidents. Elsewhere in Africa the system is used by Angola, Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana,
Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, SSo Tome and Principe, the Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Sudan,
Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe; in Europe, apart from France, it is used by Armenia, Azerbaijan, Austria, Belarus,
Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Finland, Georgia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
The Cancun Agreements
Over the last year, the United States has worked with our international partners to build on the progress achieved at the
climate change conference in Copenhagen. We have pressed for substantive steps that would advance the vision of the
Copenhagen Accord. This month we joined the nations of the world in Cancun for a new round of talks aimed at
mobilizing common action to meet the shared global challenge of climate change.
Today I am pleased to announce that we secured the Cancun Agreements, a set of balanced international decisions
under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) which represent meaningful progress in
our global response to climate change.
These agreements advance each of the core elements of the Copenhagen Accord: They anchor the Accord's mitigation
pledges; build on a system of transparency with substantial detail and content of International Consultations and
Analysis which will provide confidence that a country's pledges are being carried out; launch a new Green Climate Fund;

`Appointing Blair as EU president will have
consequences', warns Hague
William Hague's strident attack on his fellow Briton reportedly left some of the EU ambassadors baffled
Francis Elliott, David Charter and Tom Baldwin
William Hague has been conducting a behind-the-scenes campaign to convince European ambassadors that Tony Blair
would be a bad choice for European Union president, The Times has learnt. The Shadow Foreign Secretary used a lunch
organised by the Swedish presidency in London last week to lobby the most senior diplomats of the 26 other EU nations
against the appointment.
EU leaders had hoped to choose the new president at next week's summit, but the Czech Republic's last-minute
objections to the Lisbon treaty have scuppered that. President Sarkozy of France wants a quick decision, however, and is
understood to be pushing for a special one-day summit in Brussels next month to fill the new post.
In making the Conservatives' case against Mr Blair, Mr Hague said that while in Downing Street the former Prime Minister
had consistently placed a higher priority on US interests than on those of Europe. Mr Hague also reminded the diplomats
of Mr Blair's actions in the run-up to the Iraq war, according to one of those attending the lunch last Thursday.
A claim that Mr Hague told the ambassadors that the Tories would regard Mr Blair's appointment as a &quot;declaration of war&quot;
by the EU was denied, however. A spokesman for Mr Hague said that the phrase was &quot;a bit strong&quot;. Nevertheless, it was
not disputed that Mr Hague made clear that the move would have consequences for relations between Britain and
Brussels. Diplomats said that there was a &quot;clear mark of hostility&quot;.
&quot;Mr Hague wanted to leave the ambassadors in no doubt that the Conservative Party is opposed to the appointment of
Tony Blair as president of the European Council and [that] it would only underline the lack of accountability and legitimacy

Will do — looking forward to it. BTW, have you officially signed off oon my job description, per our discussion? I assume
so, but that also means paperwork, a staff assistant, and VERY IMPORTANT, an office for me and my team, which now
counts 6 permanent staff. We really need an office on the 7th floor, with representational space, as I will be bringing in
CEO's, Foundation presidents, and other prominent individuals on a range of isues, and they'll need to know that, the
Secretary takes these public/private initiatives seriously.

    <body>The House Appropriations Committee is apparently going to revise it's allocation for State/USAID — it is reportedly some
$1.3 billion better (!). So, the overall cut would be closer to $2.7 billion, not $4 billion. Will report back when that is
finalized. Some good news for a change.

The Committee circulated a suballocations report to Full Committee members in advance of tomorrow's Full Committee

allocation proposed in that report is $53.983 billion, which is $1.327 billion above our provisional allocation and the

Biden: Israel right to stop Gaza flotilla
from breaking blockade
VP Biden tells Charlie Rose that the Israel Navy
might not have needed to drop commandos onto the
Gaza-bound ship, but insists that Israel is entitled to
defend its security.
By Natasha Mozgovaya Tags: Joe Biden Gaza flotilla
U.S. Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday defended Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip and its decision
to intercept the pro-Palestinian flotilla bringing humanitarian aid to the coastal territory, though he did not
go so far as to defend the Israel Navy raid that killed nine people two days earlier.
In an interview with Charlie Rose, Biden pointed out that Israel had given pro-Palestinian activists the
option of unloading their cargo at the Ashdod port, and offered to bring it to the Gaza Strip on their
behalf.
&quot;They've said, 'Here you go. You're in the Mediterranean. This ship -- if you divert slightly north you can
unload it and we'll get the stuff into Gaza,&quot;, he said. &quot;So what's the big deal here? What's the big deal of
insisting it go straight to Gaza? Well, it's legitimate for Israel to say, 'I don't know what's on that ship.
These guys are dropping... 3,000 rockets on my people.
&quot;Look, you can argue whether Israel should have dropped people onto that ship or not -- but the truth of
the matter is, Israel has a right to know -- they're at war with Hamas -- has a right to know whether or
not arms are being smuggled in.&quot;
During the interview, Biden also blamed Hamas for the crisis that has wracked the coastal territory and for
the ongoing state of conflict with Israel.

Following up on your great recommendation during the cultural working group debrief to notify Members of Congress
when we send their constituents on our cultural programs, we have implemented a correspondence system to notify
Members upon the return of their constituents. Each week, we will review our cultural program participant list and send
letters accordingly. The basic letter template which will be personalized as needed (see attached for an example) has
been cleared by H and R to expedite the process. We will also periodically review how many participants we have from
each state and send letters to Senators as appropriate.
Today, we sent our first batch of letters out to:
Congressman Robert Brady (D-PA1)
Congresswoman Yvette Clarke (D-NY11)
Congressman Eliot Engel (D-NY17)

The article is good, just way too short, so it became very matter of fact, didn't include a lot of the great stuff he saw that
day. They cut what he turned in in half.
But for this readership, that length is probably perfect. It supposedly gets seen by 70 million people. 69 million
probably never open it up and just see it in their Sunday paper, so the cover is the ballgame. Story is basically an excuse
for the cover. And the cover is a homerun.
In the end, I firmly believe it will be the totality all these in-depth projects like Vogue, National Geographic, Nightline,
Time - which I know are annoying - that are going to create a collage documenting your success, especially in terms of
style and work ethic, which I believe is what people are most interested when it comes to their perception and approval

Early Draft: International Energy Coordinator
2009-05-17 Position Description - International Energy Coordinator - Draft.doc
B6
Attached and below is a draft of the international energy coordinator position. I have been speaking with David
Goldwyn regarding this position, which the Secretary has offered and he has accepted. We now are in the devil
in the details position description both to encompass the scope and authority of the role to accomplish key
objectives in international energy security but also to fulfill the mission outlined by the legislation that the
Secretary embraced in QFRs from Senator Lugar (who created this position and has been unhappy about it's
double-hatting in the past rather than a dedicated staffing).
Please review and advise of any suggested edits or revisions. My goal is to seek to get this to David in the early
afternoon. This is, as you will see, a bit of a high wire act as: B5
I am confident I did not capture all those goals — welcome your wisdom and guidance at your earliest
convenience -7 in text edits in caps most appreciated (preferred over general comments). We are pushing so that
by the Secretary's hearing on Weds, we can respond yes should he inquire if this position is in process.
thanks.

Re: Hague meeting
On your meeting on Friday, May 14, with new British Foreign Secretary William Hague you might explore a number of
issues below. (I've discussed with Shaun.)
1. Northern Ireland. Cameron has pledged to reduce public sector spending in NI. But the impact of public sector
spending there is not the same as in other parts of the UK because of 40 years of troubles. Political stability depends
upon economic stability. Removing funding specifically threatens community policing, creating a vacuum that the Real
IRA and other men of violence would rush into. Cutting the public sector would make it difficult to increase private
sector investment. Does the new government understand the US interest in NI and appreciate the fragility of the
situation?
2. Defense and Foreign Policy Cuts. The new government program is to slash the deficit, cutting deeply into
government programs. This really cannot be done without defense and foreign policy reductions. Seek claficiation on
exactly whether and where these cuts be made. Will they affect Afghanistan policy and over what schedule? How will
cuts in the foreign service affect British influence in other areas?
3. Trident and Nuclear Deterrent. The coalition agreement between the Conservative and Liberal Democrats allows
the LDs to abstain in parliamentary votes on four issues that will apparently let the Tories have their way: marriage tax
allowances; nuclear power; college tuition fees; and Trident and the nuclear deterrent. During the campaign, the LDs ran

I'm feeling very good about our recent efforts to connect our speeches thematically. We've done it with development,
human rights, and Internet freedom; and most recently with AIPAC, Ctr for Middle East Peace, and next the NC Here's
what I want to suggest: The three most basic elements of human existence are food, water, and health. We have now
done major speeches on food and water. I'd like us to consider a major speech on global health — the third in a trilogy.
Linking these three issues thematically, we can explain how and why foreign policy challenges and solutions must be

Joint Interview
MS —
Jake just relayed yoLir desire to cancel tomorrow's interview. But I want to make sure you are aware of a few things that
he was not in a position to share:
1) The Israeli &amp; Palestinian interviewers and their teams skipped returning home today with their principals at great
cost and energy in order to stay the extra day to you. One skipped traveling onward with Abbas.
2) Both the Israeli &amp; Palestinian media outlets involved immediately announced their joint interview and are hyping its
unprecedented nature
3) Because of #2, U.S. media is fully aware that this interview is scheduled for tomorrow morning.
So three points:
1) There is an incredibly high expectation for this interview occurring and canceling, no matter the reason cited, will be
taken to mean something negative2) The point of this interview was to shape the narrative coming out of today, and
canceling will only contribute to a negative narrative in that we will be canceling on the most important figure in Israeli
media, and I do not see Channel 2 taking that well3) As positive as the symbolism of this interview was meant to be,
we run the risk of the negative symbolism by canceling.
Typically when you want to cancel something I roll with it. But I want to strenuously object to doing so in this case. I
understand you told the participants they should refrain from public comment, but first, that doesn't mean you have to
and second, you know they won't really refrain. And I am certain they will appreciate the effusive things you have to say

    <body>The whole thing is worth a read, but a very tough judge gives you and the President credit:
By any standard of reason, President Obama and Secretary of State Canton conducted themselves very well amid the
confusion and crises Of course they didn't do everything perfectly; for example, some unidentified administration official
disowned the embassy statement condemning the video. Such creepiness served only to make it look like Obama was
running for cover at the expense of our embattled diplomats. But minor miscues aside, Obama and Clinton nailed the
main points, especially Clinton. In her first statement soon after the riots, here s what she said The United States
deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back
to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.&quot;

There weren't a huge number of updates over the evening, though the phones are getting more active again now. Late
this morning we learned that SYG Ban Ki Moon was in touch with AMB Rice, and told her that there were approximately
100 UN staff still buried under the rubble at MINUSTAH, SYG Ban formally requested
helicopter search and rescue teams. AMB Rice underscored that we need to make getting those SARs a priority.
I'm attaching our draft talking points from about an hour and a half ago; the background sections in particular have
some useful information. Currently, Southcom is conducting aerial reconnaissance of the airport to determine in what
sort of repair it is. The talking points note that several countries and organizations (Dominican Republic, Chile, UK, the
Netherlands, IADB) have offered assistance to Haiti (and info'd us). In addition to those on the list, the Israelis are trying
to send several urban search and rescue teams (some of the team members need help getting visas to transit Miami en
route to Port-au-Prince).
The UN Situation Center is in contact with MINUSTAH's Deputy Force Commander. They have been working to clear a
couple of major streets in Port-au-Prince, as noted in the talking points. They have also reviewed the airport, and their

Dear Mack:
Thank you for following up on this matter. I know she appreciated your conversation and has been concerned about this
matter.
I will flag for Lona — this week is relatively hectic so it may be a weekend or next week call but will flag now as this issue
is ripe.

Subject: Call with Secretary Clinton
Dear Cheryl,
Good morning on a consequential and indeed historic week in the life of our country given the passage of health care
reform. President Obama was courageous, persevering and skilled in his leadership and efforts. Having said that, in my
humble opinion, he would not have been successful had it not been for President Clinton's, Hillary's and our efforts in
1994. That's my story and I'm sticking to it, and I believe it's true.
I know this has been a particularly demanding week in the life of the Secretary and in your life as well. Having
Netanyahu, AIPAC and a major trip to Mexico to fight the narco-traffickers is a formidable task even for Hillary Clinton.
Cheryl, I would like to respectfully request a brief meeting or phone call with Secretary Clinton following up on the
conversation she initiated with me at the Vital Voices event regarding the IDB. It's my sense and belief that this matter
needs to be carefully handled for a number of reasons including the longstanding friendship that both the Secretary and
President Clinton have with Luis Alberto Moreno. I also have another important and timely matter (personal not
business) that I would like to discuss with Hillary in our time together.
As I think you know, I try to be very judicious about these types of requests. I think 15 minutes either in person or by

Media reports Israeli President Peres collapsed at an event in Tel Aviv this evening.
President S'iliiT■011 Peres collapsed on Saturday night during a question-and-answer session for young executives at the
Rabin Center in Tel Aviv.
The 86-year-old president fainted and collapsed on the lectern during the last question. He recovered consciousness
after a fedV seconds, at which point he was taken to a side room where Magen David Adorn medics treated him.
The president's personal physician later rushed to the scene.
After the incident, people close to Peres told Haaretz that he was feeling &quot;good,&quot; that he left the hall walking, and that

    <body>This is from Fr. Borys Gudziak, the wonderful priest you met in Lviv. He gave you a tour of the Cathedral and you had a
wonderful chat with him at the time. Since then, much progress has been made there. He became head of the new
Ukrainian Catholic University and has really come in to his own as a respected leader and scholar.
Unfortunately, his situation and that of the Catholic community and academic freedom has come under siege since
Yanokovich became president. I have a series of emails from the US Ukrainian community, in addition to this email
directly from Gudziak, They are alarmed about developments. I've been in touch with John Tefft and sent him everything.
He is aware of recent events.
I will make a folder of the correspondence for you since the community here and in Ukraine sees you as their champion.
This is not a good turn of events.

Subj: difficulties for UCU
Dear Melanne,
It has been awhile since we have been in touch. As you now we are under special pressure at the Ukrainian
Catholic University. It is a question of our welfare and future. But not only. Almost no educational institutions
have taken a stand in defense of democracy and even western Ukrainian politicians are capitulating under
pressure. So is business. The approach of the new authorities is quick and systematic. Top and middle positions
in all spheres of government, administration, state security, police have been rapidly changed and are
effectively moving in on the freedom of the press and discourse.
Our students are scared.
Some are active, but some fear for the university, that it may loose accreditation. A father and his daughter-
student came to my office in a state of anxiety.
Some students are afraid to blog and post comments because they fear that they will be traced and that their
parents will loose their jobs.
There is clear evidence from one of our banks that the authorities are beginning to dig into the question of our
finances. Provocations, moral defamation, planting of drugs and weapons in student residences as happened in
2004 before the election could be next.
The most effective defense is speaking out.
I am grateful for your solicitude and wanted to ask for two things.
1 To ask the Secretary of State to bring this to the attention of the president and vice president and to do what
she can in our defense.
2. to help us get the story to some of the main media outlets: New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street
Journal, CNN, etc. One story by any of these for us and for the people in Ukraine that have the courage to
speak the truth is invaluable.

Kerry: &quot;No plans&quot; to go to Iran
Yesterday, Iranian media reported comments from the Iranian foreign ministry spokesman that the Iranian
parliament was considering an alleged request filed by Sen. John Kerry (D-MA) to travel to Iran.
Today, Fred Jones, spokesman for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told POLITICO that &quot;John Kerry
has no plans to visit Iran.&quot;
Jones added that &quot;We never discuss the Senator's private or diplomatic conversations.&quot;
Asked if that implied that Kerry was exploring the possibility of meeting Iranian officials elsewhere in a third
country, Jones said. no. &quot;There are no plans to meet with any Iranian officials abroad.&quot;
Interestingly, for the past week, Kerry's office has used variations of &quot;unaware of plans&quot; or &quot;no plans&quot; to discuss
these Iran meetings rumors -- rather than &quot;no.&quot;
And at face value, Jones' statement today does not seem to be the kind of flat denial that Kerry had filed such a

Thank you. I will spend next week reviewing the recent IG report of my bureau. Gave us good marks on the technical
side of what we do, but there is definitely work to be done on our organizational structure, some leadership issues in
specific offices and how we interact and communicate across our various functions. On the planning side, thanks to the
2010 look ahead memos that the bureaus prepared for you, we will be more effective in creating media and outreach
opportunities because our focus will be not just on this week, but looking ahead to the month and quarter as well. We
have been briefing-centric in the past. We will be creating more channels to communicate our messages. I know Judith
spoke with you on Monday about greater emphasis on international media. We will be restructuring part of my
operation to be able to do that. Going through these issues, I'll either be well-rested or exhausted, but I am looking

Cheryl
We are gathering info on the memo on the participation agreement which I will have up to you soon. It has taken a bit
to get the right people to answer the specific questions you asked about previous agreements.
In regard to the plan memo, we will have a more detailed plan for you tomorrow. We have been waiting for the
recommendations of the new structural group that was set up in NYC last Friday afternoon (Lanny, the Chamber of
Commerce, the Committee of 100, and others). We are getting a de-brief on their plans and new structure tomorrow.
In our calls to GE's Jeff Immelt, the Chamber, and others we learned that it would not be viable to get 20 CEO's into
Washington with such short notice. The Secretary called us in last Friday and said that she was game for doing some
additional calls which everyone in the business community thinks is a more efficient way to get this done. We are
holding a meeting on Friday with the business community (up to 75 Washington reps) and would follow it up with
individual assignments. We could still build an event with CEOs around late July Strategic Dialogue.
We will get you a more detailed plan with all of the potential events and assignments.

Subject: Border Issues Update
The latest regarding border issues:
a) Per EmbOff, border at Jimani remained disorganized but functional as in recent days.
b) The flow of persons across the border is constant, but no mass influx. However, official figures under-report
the numbers of people crossing, as the data reflect only those being processed correctly. Some Haitians are
sneaking across the border, per USG official. Haitian media also report &quot;tens of thousands&quot; leaving Port-au-
Prince, some for the DR border. However, police officials say they have not seen increased illegal entry
attempts in the mountains around the Jimani crossing.
c) A Haitian immigration official said that as of lpm on 1/19 he had issued approximately 600 laissez-passes to
travelers without documents. Dominican authorities at the other side of the border crossing are generally
turning away travelers without a valid visa or official travel document. Medical emergency cases continue
being allowed in.
d) The border crossing at Jimani was closed for 45 minutes after the Haitian colonel in charge of customs on
the Haitian side began demanding &quot;manifests&quot; from vehicles trying to bring assistance across. GODR
officials managed to talk the colonel into backing down, but plan to seek his removal. (Note: It is unclear
whether this was an attempt at rent-seeking by the Haitian official, but some reporting implied that. End
Note).

Subject: UNESCO update
Huma, Joe, Jake,
We are likely to have one candidate against Hosni in round 4 of the UNESCO director general race on Monday.
EU Commissioner Ferraro-Waldner has pulled out formally.
Our UNESCO Amb. Killion reports that candidates Baki (Ecuador) and Bukova (Bulgaria) met Sunday night Paris time.
Baki has given Bukova an ultimatum. Either they form a unity ticket with Ivonne Baki on top or Baki leaves the race.
Tonight former Ferrero-Waldner supporters are considering how to vote. Mexican Dep Secretary for 10 issues called
me. They are wondering whether to support Baki in round 4 now that F-W is out.
I noted that we wanted the strongest of the ladies to stay in (Fyi, they both were on our list of the most qualified
candidates.) Too early a pull out could also affect the race.
The Egyptian candidate could lose because of a consolidation of alternative candidates.
I am sorry to report that the Egyptians have used harsh tactics in the halls of UNESCO. A member of the U.S. delegation
has seen a member of the Egyptian-hired &quot;public relations&quot; group walking around with an envelope of cash. They
pushed to have two Amb recalled. Disgust and resentment is running high.
The Egyptians are pushing delegations very hard. FM Aboul-Gheit has stopped in Paris to deal with the UNESCO race
while en route to NY for UNGA.
A/S Feltman writes that Egyptian Ambassador Shoukry has called him twice today with a &quot;message from the Foreign
Minister.&quot; FM Aboul Gheit is angry and reports President Mubarak is angry.
A/S Feltman notes &quot; maybe we've become a convenient excuse.&quot; A/S Feltman very helpfully pushed back and helped
defend our ambassador who had been criticized.
Our strategy relies on our Amb being low-key. He is following his instructions. We should be unhappy with the way he is
being attacked personally. Candidates Bukova and Baki are moving ahead on their own lobbying. FYI, Hosni even said
on French TV that the U.S. is neutral reflecting our especially low key approach this past week. Now that Hosni may
lose, the U.S. looks like a convenient one to blame.

Just talked to Holbrooke on the slopes of Telluride.
Karzai is preparing to announce his intention to proceed with the election on schedule. He has lined up Qanooni in
support.
SRAP is preparing a memo of potential options for how to move forward on this. When we have the memo I will be sure
to get it to you pronto.
If Paul has anything to add/amend, I will be sure to let you know.

STATEMENT FROM LISA MCGOVERN:
&quot;Earlier today, Jim underwent successful surgery in Washington to remove his thyroid gland. During a
recent routine examination, we discovered a small nodule that a biopsy showed to be cancerous. This type of
thyroid cancer grows very slowly, and is successfully treatable. He's feeling good, and his prognosis is
excellent. Jim will take a few days off and is looking forward to being back at work next week for the lame-
duck session. Until then, I'll be trying to convince him to rest and stay off the phone!
&quot;As Executive Director of the Congressional Families program at the Prevent Cancer Foundation, I
know how important early detection and treatment can be. Jim and I urge everyone to get their regular check-
ups and screenings, and to take steps to prevent cancer by making healthy lifestyle choices, which include a
good diet, exercise, not smoking and knowing your family history and risk factors. Lots of good information
can be found at www.preventcancer.org.&quot;
The following is a statement from Dr. Brian P. Monahan, the Congressional Attending Physician:
&quot;Congressman McGovern was admitted to the Washington Hospital Center today for surgery to remove
the thyroid gland in his neck. He was discovered to have a nodule in his thyroid gland on routine health
examination. A biopsy of this nodule showed papillary cancer of the thyroid gland. He underwent today's
procedure to remove the gland from his neck as a curative therapy for his cancer. He completed the surgery
without complications and will be discharged from the hospital after a brief period of observation.
&quot;Thyroid cancer is diagnosed in about 37,000 people in the United States each year with over 75% of
these being the papillary type. The vast majority of patients are cured with surgery and do not experience any

    <body>pvervee
Secretary Clinton —
I understand you are going to Kenya next week and while I know the trip is primarily focused on trade issues, I
wanted to flag an issue for you because I know it is near and dear to your heart.
Kenya has one of the strictest anti-abortion laws in Africa — it is illegal unless a woman's life is at risk and
criminalizes both the woman and the provider. Two years ago, Kenyan authorities imprisoned a doctor and
two nurses, falsely accusing them of providing illegal abortions. After a year in prison, the providers were
found innocent and released, but it galvanized the legal and provider community who formed a coalition to
make abortion less restrictive. It will come as no surprise to you that, as a result of their abortion law, Kenya
has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in all of Africa, with an estimated 800 women a day seeking
the procedure, often through dangerous means.
Kenya is restarting a long-stalled constitutional review process and they hope to produce a final Constitution
by next year. Religious groups are on a concerted crusade to include new language in the Constitution which
would codify that &quot;life begins at conception&quot;. The current Constitution is largely silent on the issue. If this fetal
personhood amendment goes forward, it would place Kenya in the small community of nations with such a
provision. It would clearly mark Kenya as out of stop with countries attempting to institutionalize the African
Union's Maputo Protocol, one of the most progressive regional documents on women, development and
reproductive rights, and with the vast majority of African countries in general. For a country trying to regain
the momentum of stability and success it enjoyed until recently, such a policy imposition would be a
regression for women's rights and for the country writ large.
I went to Kenya last month to work with the coalition that has formed to strategize against the Constitutional
amendment and to work toward a less restrictive abortion law. I also visited several of our clinics and
providers in Nairobi and in nearby villages where Planned Parenthood has programs to train providers in post
abortion care. You have seen this a million times in your travels around the world, so I don't need to tell you
how poignant the stories were of the lives saved and lost, the bravery in standing up to constant government
harassment, and the fear of what this potential Constitutional amendment will mean to the provision of safe
medical services. I know it is asking a lot, but if there is any way that you could draw attention to this issue
when you are in Kenya, you would be even more of my personal hero than you already are. It is our hope that
if Kenya knows the world is watching they may be more careful in how they proceed. Of course we would be
happy to help you in any way if you decide you want to do something on this while you are there. There is also
a Congressional delegation going to Kenya the week of August 8th and we are working on them to have a side
meeting on this issue as well.
As always, thank you so much for all you do. We are all so grateful that you are there! All best, Laurie

food security is an issue you are majoring on and would love to meet with you in person to discuss this and to explore

Background: S/E Mitchell met with Foreign Minister Aboul Gheit and EGIS Chief Omar Solimon on January 24 in Cairo.
While Solimon responded positively to S/E Mitchell's request that Egypt encourage Palestinian President Abbas to agree
to proximity talks, Aboul Gheit asserted that the Palestinians should not agree to any form of negotiations until Israel
has taken action on the &quot;five steps&quot; requested by the Palestinians. Aboul Gheit then hosted a meeting on February 3
with Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and Jordanian FM Nasser Judeh, which Solimon attended in part. Egypt and

Still working this through, but here is where we are thus far:
The majority of all countries that have direct presidential elections use a Two-Round system. The number appears to be
at least 58.
France, most Latin American countries, all five post-Soviet Central Asian republics, and many countries in francophone
Africa use TRS to elect their presidents. Elsewhere in Africa the system is used by Angola, Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana,
Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Sao Tome and Principe, the Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Sudan,
Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe; in Europe, apart from France, it is used by Armenia, Azerbaijan, Austria, Belarus,
Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Finland, Georgia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia
and Ukraine; and it is found in Afghanistan, Haiti, Indonesia, Iran, Timor-Leste and Yemen.

Status update on the Chris Stevens mission to Benghazi:
The current game plan is for Mr. Stevens to move no later than Wednesday from Malta to Benghazi. He will stage off
shore initially for a one day visit during which he will have meetings with TNC interlocutors and get a sense of the
situation on the ground. The goal of this one day trip is for him to lay the groundwork for a stay of up to 30 days.
He will be accompanied by a DS team, a staff member from Embassy Tripoli and the leader of USAID's DART team. With
the support of Ambassador Cretz and Embassy Tripoli, Mr Stevens is in contact with TNC members on the ground in
Benghazi and elsewhere; the team is also in contact with other diplomatic missions and NGOs in Benghazi. We expect to
get support in particular from the Turks who have a consulate in Benghazi.
Mr. Stevens team has been in touch with Africom planners on the details of the mission. We have made the official
request for support from OSD but have yet to get approval. Once we have that — and we hope that will be very soon --
we will be able to move forward with the planning.

RE: gorgeous pie on the front page of the NWT!
Bic sending more arms into a society generally — particularly when they are as disorganized and fragmented as they are
— will result in more violence — against each other. Boys like to play with guns (trust me as the mother of sons). I am all
for saying we have no objection to French doing it to increase pressure on Gaddafi, but in a tribal society where conflicts
have been repressed for so long, adding even more weapons does not make sense. Obviously they can get weapons
from other places, but nb that they are not awash in weapons now. I wrote something for New York Review of Books
this week that builds on my farewell remarks and I think you will like it; will send it to you for weekend reading,

We were judging the candidates for the Swanee Hunt Award which goes annually to a FS0 and a FSN judged superior
for integrating women's issues into their work. T hey are nominated by ambassadors at posts or AS's here.
I called her because we had a tie for the FSO's and I wanted to see if she'd provide a second monetary award so we
wouldn't have to divide the $5k. She agreed and then told me
State will fly in the awardees and the Secry usually gives out the award. Swanee is hoping that she'll be able to come and
be there for the brief ceremony.

Posted on Dec 5, 2010
Fake news by Andy Borovvibe;
WASHINGTON—In the first major policy fallout from the WikiLeaks disclosures, the State Department has ordered all
U.S. diplomats to &quot;cease and desist telling the truth until further notice.&quot;
&quot;We are working overtime to fly to make sure that leaks like these don't happen again,&quot; Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
told reporters. &quot;But until we've got the leaks plugged, it's incumbent on all our diplomats to put on their lying caps.&quot;
Clinton noted that since many U.S. diplomats are major political donors with long careers in the business world, &quot;this
shouldn't be a reach for them.&quot; But for those career diplomats who came up through the Foreign Service, the State
Department will be holding a series of &quot;truth avoidance seminars,&quot; led by executives of Goldman Sachs.

The current situation is that Brown and Cowen are in Belfast, and met with Robinson, McGuinness, and other parties
until 330 in the morning Belfast time. They have now resumed today. The sticking point is parades. Robinson wants the
current parades commission abolished because it gives Republicans too much say. McGuinness refuses to allow the

    <body>JERUSALEM, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Israeli police recommended on Sunday that state prosecutors charge
Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman for bribery, fraud and money laundering. Lieberman, whose
ultranationalist Yisrael Beiteinu party is a key partner in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ruling coalition,
accused police of waging a &quot;campaign of persecution&quot; against him and said their allegations were
unfounded. In a statement, police said a nine-year investigation found &quot;a basis of evidence&quot; against Lieberman
of bribe-taking, fraud, violation of public confidence and obstruction of justice with regard to suspected money
laundering. The investigation, conducted mostly while Lieberman held other government posts, focused on the
transfer of millions of Israeli shekels to shell companies and accounts belonging to people close to him, the
statement said. Lieberman, in a statement released by his spokesman, said there was &quot;no basis for the police
recommendation&quot; and expressed confidence he would not be indicted. Police handed their recommendation to
state prosecutors who have to decide whether to charge Lieberman, the latest in a line of Israeli public figures to

Republican votes. I think they know we are now well north of 67 votes. On the second, we have confirmed with the
parliamentarian that we can move from the treaty to the appropriations bill by consent or with a simple majority vote.
So if we begin start on tuesday night there is a way to get both measures done by the weekend. We will keep working it
with Reid staff and floor staff over the weekend. If you have any reason to speak with Durbin (he's on sunday shows) or

    <body>Everyone has their favorite scenario, but it seems fairly obvious that it will be almost impossible
for Gordon to hang on. This process may take some days. Jonathan, who knows Clegg, says he's
basically not who his voters think he is but a pro-Europeanist Tory. When Clegg was
contemplating a political career he consulted Jonathan. Clegg comes from a Tory family.
Jonathan told him to become a Tory, join a real political party rather than the Lib Dems, but
Clegg thought he would advance further with LDs. So several theories: 1. Clegg makes an
outright deal with Cameron, including for some form of proportional representation (giving LDs
more seats in future elections) and cabinet positions. Clegg might become foreign secretary
under this scenario. This is the scenario Jonathan believes may well happen. 2. Clegg supports
Cameron to form a minority government, but doesn't go into a coalition. Instead his deal involves
Cameron dropping almost the whole Tory program but a joint program on financial recovery to
be proposed in the Queen's Speech (equivalent of State of the Union). I find this far-fetched. But
who knows? 3. Clegg supports Cameron to form government, makes no deals. Jonathan
Freedland, who spent last week with Clegg, told me today that Clegg told him a deal with
Gordon would appear dirty. Yet making a deal with Cameron would also make Clegg to be a
dealmaker, even without a deal on program. These are the convolutions people are going through
waiting for resolution. Then, Gordon: Gordon is trying to figure out how to form a coalition.
Clegg is refusing him. Gordon may propose Clegg's maximum demands to him to see if he will
publicly refuse them. Hard to know when this comes to a head and if and when Gordon departs.
Jonathan told me that Tony's view is that Gordon will go but that he couldn't see how Gordon
would understand it or exactly how he would go. Barring any clear process, skipping ahead,
David appears to be frontrunner for successor as leader of opposition. He would be well
positioned to be the future PM if he plays it right under these circumstances. More to come...
Also:
1. You might consider making a statement on Europe and the financial crisis, not a detailed
policy statement but a general statement, a little music to position support for Merkel, which she

Subject: Lebanon has a cabinet
Hariri just announced the formation of a cabinet. It's divided 15-10-5 (15 ministers with March 14, 10
ministers with March 8, 5 ministers with President Sleiman). The ones of most concern to us -- Defense (our
help to LAF), Interior (help to police plus municipal elections), Justice (Hariri Tribunal), Finance (can veto
anything because of financial implications) are all either with March 14 or Presidency. That's good. Foreign .
Affairs is with a new guy from Nabih Berri's bloc. with Lebanon rotating onto the Security Council. 1.4(D)
B1
Next step: Hariri and his cabinet have 30 days to come up with the ministerial declaration, basically a
platform, that must be presented to the Parliament along with the cabinet slate for a vote of confidence. This,
too, may be painful, as they debate how to describe &quot;the resistance&quot; in ways that don't cross either U.S. or
Hizballah red lines.

Dear Cheryl,
Congratulations on the launch of the $20b G8 initiative. This will stand as a historic success of President Obama and
Secretary Clinton. Please do convey my personal congratulations and gratitude to Secretary Clinton if you have a
moment to do so. I know what a key role you personally played in bringing this to fruition.
I would like to suggest one overarching strategy for success.
Please do push hard on the donors (USAID included!) to pool the donor resources into one, at most two, multilateral
funding streams. Certainly the World Bank should be the main spigot, and IFAD possibly a second. By pooling the
resources, we'll cut down BY YEARS on the delays, donor negotiations, further talk, report writing, expert trips, etc., etc.,
which are now the biggest single threat to success of the initiative.

    <body>You may have been alerted to this incident: the barring of Noam Chomsky from Israel. His political views may be
ridiculous or objectionable, though he is the greatest linguistic scholar in the world, but barring him for his political opinions
has created a needless PR disaster, not least for the US, as he is, after all, a US citizen, and a very prominent one
internationally. It is unfortunate on every level. And the US should not be a passive onlooker. He is a US citizen barred for
his political views, after all. This story is splashed across the European press this morning. Not what anyone needs, yes,
yes, like a hole in the head, and bone stupid, but the US effort on his behalf to gain entry should be part of the story. This
incident can be profitable if Israel understands it should not be doing this to US or European critics in the future. This is a
downward slope, bad news for everyone involved. S

Chomsky Barred From West Bank by Israel
By ROBERT MACKEY
Noam Chomsky, an American linguist and political thinker who has been critical of Israel, was denied entry into the West
Bank on Sunday by Israeli immigration officials when he tried to cross into the Palestinian territory from Jordan to deliver a
lecture.
Amira Hass of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported:
No reason was initially given for the decision, but the Interior Ministry later said immigration officials at the Allenby Bridge
border crossing from Jordan had misunderstood Chomsky's intentions thinking initially he was also due to visit Israel.
Chomsky, who is on a speaking tour in the region, was scheduled to speak at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank on
Monday.
A spokeswoman for Israel's interior ministry also told Reuters that there had been a misunderstanding and &quot;officials were
trying to get clearance from the Israeli military, which controls access to the West Bank to allow Chomsky to enter.&quot;
In a television interview from Amman, Jordan, after he was rebuffed, Mr. Chomsky told Al Jazeera English, &quot;the facts were
completely clear to everyone; there was no basis for a misunderstanding.&quot; He explained that he was interrogated for
several hours before being told that he would not be allowed to cross into the occupied Palestinian territory. The 81-year-
old scholar added:
I can only say what was conveyed to me in the discussion with the official who was carrying out the interrogation — he
was receiving instructions from the [Israeli] ministry of interior and relaying them. There were two basic points. One was
that the government of Israel does not like the kinds of things I say — which puts them into the category of I suppose
every other government in the world. The second was that they seemed upset about the fact that I was just taking an
invitation from Bir Zeit and I had no plans to go on to speak in Israeli universities, as I have done many times in the past
but not this time.
Mr. Chomsky had been invited to speak about American foreign and domestic policy by the philosophy department at the
Palestinian university in Ramallah.
The renowned linguist was outspoken in his opposition to the Israeli offensive in Gaza, which ended in January 2009 and
has criticized Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory many times.
In an interview with Deborah Solomon of The New York Times Magazine in 2003, Mr. Chomsky said, &quot;I objected to the
founding of Israel as a Jewish state. I don't think a Jewish or Christian or Islamic state is a proper concept. I would object
to the United States as a Christian state.&quot; When Ms. Solomon pressed Mr. Chomsky on his opposition to Israel, saying,
&quot;Your father was a respected Hebraic scholar, and sometimes you sound like a self-hating Jew,&quot; he replied:
It is a shame that critics of Israeli policies are seen as either anti-Semites or self-hating Jews. It's grotesque. If an Italian

If our early assessment of today's election in Honduras holds, we will have just been witness to a remarkable thing:
Honduran voters have taken back their democracy from two failed leaders -- Zelaya and Micheletti -- who had driven
Honduras to isolation and despair.
The turnout (probably a record) and the clear rejection of the Liberal Party shows our approach was the right one, and
puts Brazil and others who would not recognize the election in an impossible position. As we think about what to say, I
would strongly recommend that we not be shy. We should congratulate the Honduran people, we should connect

    <body>Below are points for the press on the plane. I'll have a hard copy printed:
First major ministerial in Afghanistan since the 1970s. The very fact of it is a big deal.
Context is important. This is not out of the blue, it's not just a random gathering; it's part of a systematic process:
Karzai's inauguration, announcement of the President's strategy, London conference, Peace Jirga, and now the Kabul
conference.
Increasing Afghan leadership and ownership: They are presenting a set of concrete programs on governance, service
delivery, security transition, economic development, and reintegration. These programs are detailed; they are serious;
and they reflect months of work and consultation.
Increasing international alignment: The international community is coordinating with each other - through ISAF, Sedwill,
de Mistura, etc. - and aligning its efforts with the Afghan programs and priorities being set forth at this conference. This
is NOT a pledging conference. It is an opportunity to ensure we are effectively supporting Afghan government
leadership and ownership
Follow-through and accountability: In his inauguration, Karzai laid out a credible vision; in London, the Afghan
government committed to developing and pursuing specific plans in a variety of areas; at Kabul, we'll be heavily focused
on implementation. This is about mutual accountability for the pledges made and the programs set forth.
July 2011: The president's strategy reflects both urgency and resolve: increased resources and intensity in our efforts to
take the fight to the enemy and to build Afghan capacity to effect a conditions-based transition; and a long-term civilian
commitment to support Afghanistan long into the future.
Clear strategy: Reverse the momentum of the Taliban; build the capacity of Afghan security forces; and as Afghans
develop the capability to stabilize their country, we must draw down our combat presence and make a responsible
transition to Afghan leadership.

    <subject>FW: 1st known case of a successful social media campaign in Syria</subject>
    <body>When Jared and I went to Syria, it was because we knew that Syrian society was growing increasingly young (population
will double in 17 years) and digital and that this was going to create disruptions in society that we could potential
harness for our purposes.
In what is the 1st of what I predict will be many interesting cases in the future, this past week a campaign went viral on
Facebook in Syria (even though Facebook is outlawed in Syria it is widely accessed through proxies) showing teachers in
Syria abusing their pupils. Thousands of Syrians made public their support on Facebook (the fact that people made their
identities known is notable) for the campaign to remove these teachers, and the Ministry of Education intervened and
fired the teachers.
This is the first known case of a successful social media campaign in Syria.
More will come.

Hi Hillary, you are doing an amazing job as our Secretary of State and we are all immensely proud of you.
Really enjoyed your recent remarks regarding Afghanistan. Your words were spot on. Fyi, I will be in Kabul, Afghanistan
from 7 thru 14 April and am being hosted by Flamed Wardak, the son of the Afghanistan Secretary of Defense. Looking
forward to the visit.
There is some exciting personal news that I wanted to share with you. Although it has not yet been announced, I wanted
you to know that I recently interviewed with Cisco President ( John Chambers) and accepted a senior executive position
( effective 4 May ) to be the face and thought leader for Cisco in the field of &quot;Intelligent Urbanization&quot; with my focus
area being on Physical Safety and Security.
My wife (Faith) and I will live in Bangalore, India ( we are very excited ) and my area of responsibility will be the
emerging markets of Asia, Middle East and Africa . Since I will operate from India that particular country will be a major
focal point.
The use of the Network to improve the quality of life of Millions of people in areas such as Education, Health Care and
Security will be a major thrust of &quot; Intelligent Urbanization&quot;. Faith and I are pumped up about our new overseas
adventure and the chance to work for a world class company and a superb business leader like John Chambers.
It is really a wonderful opportunity to positively impact many lives around the Globe.
Hope to perhaps call on you for a few minutes before I head over to India.
All the best and God Bless.

Subject: Advisory committee status and recommendations
Hillary,
I admire the way you handled yourself during your trip to Pakistan. It reminds me of the daunting job before you and it's
potential.
Successfully engaging the power of the DOS and the array of relevant external relationships on behalf of your goals will
remain a central challenge.
As we discussed, gathering a handful of loyal and trusted outside advisors could provide a valuable tool in this regard.
Given your late October or early November target for the first meeting, I have been working with Cheryl to come up with
a date. I guess given all that is going on possible dates seem to continually slip away.
I would understand if, in the context of everything on your plate this advisory group is just not practical. However, if you
do feel that such a gathering would be helpful and want to proceed, I believe you need to step in, select the initial date
or dates (with risk that it may need to change) and extend the invitations. A quick note to Mickey, Gordon, Maggie and

    <body>First and most important: Do NOT, repeat, NOT, call any prospective winner on either Election
Night, May 6, or on the next day, Friday, May 7. The result will be unclear. It will not be clear,
even perhaps by Friday afternoon. Today, the combined polls show Cameron and the
Conservatives ahead but not winning an outright majority. The latest Guardian poll, out
tomorrow, shown me by Alan Rusbridger today, has the Tories falling short of a majority of
seats. Even if Cameron were to win an outright majority, Brown and Labour will attempt to
make a deal with Clegg and the Liberal Democrats. Brown remains as Prime Minister unless the
Tories win outright, which take a long time to determine. Labour and the Lib-Dems will almost
certainly gain about 60 percent of the vote, more or less. Brown will reach out to Clegg to stay in
power. The deal will be that Brown will approve a referendum on proportional representation
giving the LDs much greater representationin future elections. That will spell the end forever of
the Tories ever coming to power. The Tories see the election in apocalyptic terms—and they are
not wrong. Brown's weakness heralds the sort of grand progressive coalition/alliance that Tony
imagined but was never able to attempt between Labour and the LDs. Brown offering the
referendum would be the first step toward that. In the case of the Tories falling short of an
outright majority in seats, they will respond as though Brown is acting illegitimately, which he
would not be by remaining as PM and dealing with Clegg. Informed people are already talking
of what might begin to unfold on Friday as &quot;Florida.&quot; The Tories, backed by the Murdoch press,
will attempt to push Labour aside by force majeure—something that will not succeed under those
circumstances. The Murdochs are almost literally going crazy. James Murdoch and hiw wife

As you know I have good links to the Qataris. Sheikha Mosah's son is the 31/32 year old Crown Prince and she is keen
that he starts to build a wider international profile. He has been appointed head of the Qatar National Food Security
Programme which is designed to deal with Qatar's food security issues its a $30 billion programme. He is aware that
food security is an issue you are majoring on and would love to meet with you in person to discuss this and to explore
potential partnership areas between US and Qatar including possible participation in the US/World Bank Food Security
Fund. He is also keen to talk more generally about US/Qatari cooperation and even suggested they could help out with
the Oil spill problem. There is apparently a Arab Food Security Summit in October 2010 and he would like to discuss Us
participation in that too.
IS a meeting possible he is more flexible on place and times than his mother! Or maybe we could set up an initial phone

Update on Ukraine Election Situation
With over 99.9 percent of the vote in Ukraine counted, Yanukovych leads by 3.5 percent
(almost 900,000 votes) and is the clear winner and next president. The Central Election
Commission should complete its vote tabulation today and must certify the results within ten
days; certification is expected as early as Friday. Tymoshenko, who has been silent publicly,
plans to bring cases of alleged electoral fraud to the courts, but they will not change the
result. Tymoshenko claims that she intends to work within the law and not to incite street
protests.

I was delighted to see the Rothkopf piece yesterday, and not only b/c he mentioned me! It identified State as the source
of big ideas under your leadership, ideas that adapt our foreign policy to a 21st c world and allow us to get things done.
As I think about what I want to sink my teeth into over the next 18 months and how I can best serve you, I have
concluded that I want to devote myself full time to the QDDR. -- driving the process and the outcomes as efficiently and
effectvely as possible. I have run something like this before; I know almost all the players; my staff is well plugged into
the building; and I am committed to all the ideas that we want to see emerge. Instead of hiring a senior director, I
propose that the AID designate and I start driving the process by working w/ Karen and the staff and reporting
to/engaging the senior leadiership team on a weekly basis.
As Cheryl and I discussed, I am well aware that taking on this role means cutting many other things that I do. The
demands for policy planning talks have been proliferating because they serve the interests of the bureaus. I am less
convinced that they are the best use of my time or that they allow me to best serve you. There are 2 sets -- one with 5
middle eastern countries that we have agreed to hold in Jordan this fall -- this is their second meeting -- and the second
round of the russia-eu-us talks that I think it would be very detrimental to cancel. But I shd b able to make those each 3

    <subject>Memo on Tony Blair, politics behind Eu presidency &amp; Berlin trip. Sid</subject>
    <body>CONFIDENTIAL
October 23, 2009
For: Hillary
From: Sid
Re: Tony Blair, EU presidency, Tory Party, &amp; Berlin trip
One of your agenda items behind the scenes on your Berlin trip can be to discuss the future of the EU, the
European presidency and the prospects of Tony Blair. If Blair does not become EU president the position will
likely be filled by a third rank nonentity in the Brussels bureaucratic mode incapable of realizing the
possibilities in the creation of the office, continuing the feebleness of Europe as a political idea and reality. Of
course, it is in the US interest to have a strong Europe—and the naming of the first European president might be
the most important opportunity for the US to strengthen Europe, to give it actual sinew, for a long time and a
long time to come.
The Conservative Party is split over Europe and Blair. Hague represents the Tory right, which is the center of
the party. He is supported prominently by Boris Johnson, mayor of London, also known as the Tory &quot;clown
prince.&quot; The responsible wing, such as Chris Patten, the former European Commissioner, and Douglas Hurd,
former Foreign Secretary, are pro-European and not necessarily hostile to having Blair there as a counter-weight
to the anti-Europeans of their own government, helping to tilt things more their way. All present themselves as
&quot;pro-American,&quot; sine qua non of Conservative rhetoric, though there is a nasty anti-American undercurrent on
the Tory right. Hague tried to paper this over in his conference with you and was disingenuous about the nature
of the far right parties the Tories are aligned with in Europe. Nobody in the UK or Europe is fooled.

Ambassador Holbrooke is scheduled to attend the Brussels Forum, March 26 - 27. The Forum is
similar to the Munich Security Conference: a collection of high-profile leaders, journalists
and policy-makers from the U.S., Europe and Asia. The Forum is sponsored by the German
Marshall Fund (Ron Asmus), and Ambassador Holbrooke has attended every year. His presence
this year consists of two things: 1) bilat meetings including those with EU High Rep
Catherine Ashton, Codel Casey, Nato Sec Gen Rasmussen, Ambassador Daalder, and Ambassador
Kennard (some with Mullen); and 2) an internationally televised BBC discussion on Afghanistan
and Pakistan with Admiral Mullen. The panel will be shown live and broadcast on BBC World

It may be worth putting together a small group to think through the issue in some depth to decide whether there is a more
proactive strategy that may be possible and/or worth engaging in one or more countries :
1. Define human rights challenges around gay communities in many of our partner countries
2. Define the social political context (ie: how does civil society and the political/legislative activity converge or not
converge)
3. Potential role of Judicial response (eg: Adult Disability Act in US)
4. Role of multilateral and normative bodies
We are quietly doing this in PEPFAR over the next two months to assess whether we can work behind the politics to
increase the &quot;safe space&quot; for our populations seeking and/or in care (increase identification, entry and retention).
Cheryl, I hope you have a wonderful holiday, heading back to SF now, back in Monday (28th)

Strategic Communications
First, let me say how shocked we all were by the news over the weekend. I know this is a very difficult time for everyone
at the Mission and our thoughts are with all of you.
I had a good conversation with Jim Williams about the strategic communications initiative and I wanted to bring you up
to speed on our thinking and where things stand with Keith.
Based on our discussions and the excellent paper that Jim prepared I think there are several critical areas that we need
to address:
• Work with our counterparts in the Mexican government to help them develop their capacity to handle the
communications aspects of the drug initiative more effectively
• Develop a process for ensuring the GOM and USG have clear, coordinated and consistent messaging on all
aspects of the initiative
• Increase public awareness in Mexico about &quot;Merida&quot; ; based on a report I got from INR last week there is very
little awareness or understanding of the program in Mexico and the contributions of USG
• Work with GOM to develop an on-going and effective communications strategy at all levels to provide people
across the country with information that is directly relevant to them and which they need to navigate their way
through this crisis. For example, what is going on in their community; what are local authorities doing; what
programs are available in their schools; what can they do, etc. I have increasingly come to believe that the lack
of this sort of &quot;personally relevant&quot; information at a time of crisis increases public anxiety and contributes to the
overall sense of things being out of control. We have begun to focus on this issue and have worked both in Haiti
and last year in Pakistan to provide people with a steady stream of information they can use. We are using a
wide array of communications tools to deliver these messages that allows the information to be delivered in a
very granular ,local, personal way. The other benefit of this approach is that it helps balance the steady stream
of gruesome news being put out by traditional media.
• Work with private sector in both Mexico and US to develop broad based PSA campaign to increase awareness of
the initiative and maintain public support for the effort
• Increase awareness in Mexico of USG efforts to combat drug use in US
Keith has reached out to a number of his associates at BDA and unfortunately he has met with some resistance to BDA
taking this project on. The personal safety issue seems to be the biggest concern. I do believe we will be able to
overcome this to some degree and I have some ideas which we can discuss when we next speak. In the meantime I have

USGLC Applauds Choice of Dr. Rajiv Shah as USAID Administrator
In Choosing Dr. Shah, President Signals Important Role Development Plays in Foreign Policy
Washington, DC — The U.S. Global Leadership Coalition released the following statement from Executive Director Liz
Schrayer on President Obama's announcement of Dr. Rajiv Shah to be Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International
Development:
`The USGLC applauds the President's nomination of Dr. Rajiv Shah to be USAID Administrator as yet another example of
the President's commitment to elevating our civilian-led, smart power tools. With a robust International Affairs Budget
request for FY 2010, a pledge to double foreign assistance by 2015, a Presidential Study Directive on Global Development
and the State Department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, the Administration continues to demonstrate
the essential role development and diplomacy play in our foreign policy.
&quot;Rajiv Shah is a fresh and dynamic addition to President Obama's foreign policy team. Dr. Shah will bring expertise and
energy to a critical agency in need of strong, empowered leadership. His career in global development, global health and
agricultural development give him real perspective to lead USAID. He is already an important player in the Administration's
food security initiative, and his additional background in fighting global poverty and promoting global health make him an
ideal candidate for this important post.
&quot;The USGLC's broad, bipartisan coalition welcomes Dr. Shah's nomination to be USAID Administrator, and we look forward
to working with him to strengthen the role of development&quot;

Subject: Amb. KhallIzad on This Week with Christiane Amanpour
From today's roundtable on Afghanistan with Amb. Khalilzad, George Will, and Zbigniew Brzezinski:
ZB: ... We haven't had a better alternative than Karzai, and yet some of our officials have
made a sport of maligning him. This business of corruption doesn't take into account
cultural differences. And last but not least, who are we here in Washington to be moaning
and groaning about corruption?
CA: Let me ask you then, should Ambassador Eikenberry leave? I mean, has he done a good job,
do you think, for the diplomacy, George?
GW: Well he has a hopeless job to do, so it's hard to say whether he's done it well. If he
should leave because of what was said in the -
CA: What he has written in the cables?
GW: Well, who's going to be left in the government, starting with the Secretary of State?
ZK: I think he has been damaged very badly by the leaks that have taken place here in
Washington, before WikiLeaks and afterwards. And a trusting relationship, if that is the
objective, and I believe it ought to be, would require I think changes to the personnel that
are responsible on a day-to-day basis in dealing with President Karzai.
... [exchange about corruption and about Iran]
CA: Do you think, I asked George, Ambassador Eikenberry is doing a good job and should he
stay in his position?

First of all, thank you again for the telcon and heads up, I very much appreciated the consideration
and professional courtesy.
Per our conversation, if it is still helpful, I have a couple of candidates to suggest for the deputy slot at
USAID. Perhaps you have already heard of these individuals, given that they are well known in the
international development arena.
These are all superb career officers. I know each person very well, and have seen them in various
positions where they consistently handled the most complex, difficult and important assignments in an
outstanding manner. The all have terrific reputations, and are highly regarded in USAID, State, and
on the Hill.

Still working this through, but here is where we are thus far:
The majority of all countries that have direct presidential elections use a Two-Round system. The number appears to be
at least 58.
France, most Latin American countries, all five post-Soviet Central Asian republics, and many countries in francophone
Africa use TRS to elect their presidents. Elsewhere in Africa the system is used by Angola, Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana,
Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Sao Tome and Principe, the Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Sudan,
Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe; in Europe, apart from France, it is used by Armenia, Azerbaijan, Austria, Belarus,
Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Finland, Georgia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia

I appreciate being included in the dialogue last evening. I now have a much better appreciation for the challenges, as
well as the pressures you and the Secretary address each day. While I suspect there is not much that those of us on the
&quot;outside&quot; can do to help, call on me at any time if I can assist in any fashion. Not to be too dramatic about it but the
Secretary's success is in the country's interests. Reference was made last night to more rest for HRC-I have to believe
that with the rigors of your job a little R+R for you is in order-hopefully you can work out some personal time over the
holiday period.
By the way, can you give me an email for Capricia Marshall?

Subject: Trip reading -- Bangladesh is following the lead of the QDDR
This is a very thoughtful piece that identifies many of the same factors we are in our diplomatic chapter (and that is not
just because the author – the former Bangladesh ambassador to the US—cites me). What is most striking is that it
affirms that our analysis in the QDDR offers a set of questions that foreign ministries all over the world are grappling
with. I had hoped to have time to do some traveling to broadcast the QDDR to key allies and partners around the world
after the QDDR is in, but even if that can't happen, we will devise an outreach strategy re sending the report out to
foreign ministers around the world and to our ambassadors that will greatly amplify its impact. AM

U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue Media Summary
The U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue dominated Pakistani media on March 24 and March 25. All major English and Urdu
language networks carried live the Secretary and Foreign Minister Qureshi's remarks at the opening session. On
Thursday morning, nearly all television networks led with coverage of the joint press availability. All major English and
Urdu language dailies featured the talks on their front pages, highlighting the Secretary's announcement of $125 million
in aid to Pakistan's energy sector. Reporting was straight-forward with favorable headlines: Dawn—&quot;U.S, Pakistan
pledge to boost and broaden ties&quot; and &quot;U.S. to provide $125m for energy, power plants&quot;; The News—&quot;US vows to boost
energy, defence, trade ties&quot;; Nawa-i-Waqt—&quot;U.S. will neither abandon nor dictate to Pakistan&quot;; The Nation—&quot;New day'
for US, Pakistan: Hillary.&quot; Media highlighted the positive shift in U.S.-Pakistan relations, echoing Secretary Clinton's
statement that the talks are the beginning of a new chapter. Reports also focused on the question of nuclear
cooperation and U.S. engagement in the Kashmir dispute; however the U.S. position on these issues had been widely
reported by the media prior to the Dialogue. The Nation published an editorial, entitled &quot;Negative starting note,&quot;

    <body>Subject Pinera-Insulza
See the report below: Pinera has announced his support.
I had a long conversation with Craig a little while ago. He spoke with a number of people in Chile, including his close
friend,
According to Craig, Pinera had made the calculation that it would be politically untenable to dump Insulza. Apparently
there is a coalition leadership in the lower house, and Insulza's party, Concertacion, controls the upper house. So he had
no choice.
That said, Craig believes that his clear message had an impact on what Pinera told Insulza. He apparently gave his
support with two conditions: (1) don't interfere in Chilean politics, and (2) take the democratization agenda seriously
and don't carry the ALBA countries' water.
Craig also said that Arturo had been effective in making clear that the jury was out on Insulza in Washington -- that had
an impact on the Pinera government and reinforced their second message to him.
Bottom line: Craig said we couldn't have talked Pinera off of this, but we helped drive a stronger set of conditions on
Pinera's support.

Dear all:
To update you, at G we have been working on water and World Water Day (the event planned takes place at the
National Geographic Building), since I am taking on water as the key issue I am/will working on. I sent S a memo on
water in December outlining our plans. Note that we are mandated to report to Congress annually as part of the &quot;Water
for the Poor&quot; Act.
I have met with Kern-Ann, with OES &quot;water&quot; staff in the last weeks to address this and also with several regional bureau
A/S (Carson, Feltman, Blake so far) on water in the respective regions.
There is a great deal of interest on their part and we have started outlining specific initiatives that we could focus on.
We've also met on the Nile Basin Initiative, with World Bank &quot;experts&quot; leading NG0s, McKinsey, etc. I've also spoken to
Raj (USAID allocated about $480 million in FY 2009 to water, and MCC about $500 million) but of course he has been
unable to focus on this. And Cheryl and I haven't spoken yet about Food Security/water.
Best,
Maria

JOINT COMMUNIQUÉ OF
THE GOVERNMENTS OF HAITI AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ISSUED AT PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI JANUARY 17,
2010
President Rene Preval of Haiti and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton of the United States of America met in Port-
au-Prince in the wake of the catastrophic earthquake of January 12, 2010 and its tragic aftermath, and issued the
following joint communiqué:
Recognizing:
the long history of friendship between the people of Haiti and the people of the United States and their mutual respect
for each other's sovereignty;
the grievous suffering of the people of Haiti, including the massive loss of life, widespread injuries, and extensive
damage to public infrastructure and private property;
the urgent need for an immediate response to the requests by the Government of Haiti and the paramount importance
of safe, swift and effective implementation of rescue, relief, recovery, and reconstruction efforts;
the current, unprecedented challenges facing the Haitian Government; and
the January 15, 2010 conversation between President Obama and President Preval underscoring the urgency of the
needs of Haiti and its people, President Obama's pledge of the full support of the American people for the Government
and people of Haiti in relation to both the immediate recovery effort and the long-term rebuilding effort, and the two
Presidents' commitment to coordinate assistance among the various parties, including the Haitian Government, the
United Nations, the United States and the many international partners and organizations on the ground;
President Preval, on behalf of the Government and people of Haiti, welcomes as essential the efforts in Haiti by the
Government and people of the United States to support the immediate recovery, stability and long-term rebuilding of
Haiti and requests the United States to assist as needed in augmenting security in support of the Government and
people of Haiti and the United Nations, international partners and organizations on the ground;

Re: British election
First and most important: Do NOT, repeat, NOT, call any prospective winner on either Election Night, May 6,
or on the next day, Friday, May 7. The result will be unclear. It will not be clear, even perhaps by Friday
afternoon. Today, the combined polls show Cameron and the Conservatives ahead but not winning an outright
majority. The latest Guardian poll, out tomorrow, shown me by Alan Rusbridger today, has the Tories falling
short of a majority of seats. Even if Cameron were to win an outright majority, Brown and Labour will attempt
to make a deal with Clegg and the Liberal Democrats. Brown remains as Prime Minister unless the Tories win
outright, which take a long time to determine. Labour and the Lib-Dems will almost certainly gain about 60
percent of the vote, more or less. Brown will reach out to Clegg to stay in power. The deal will be that Brown
will approve a referendum on proportional representation giving the LDs much greater representationin future
elections. That will spell the end forever of the Tories ever coming to power. The Tories see the election in
apocalyptic terms—and they are not wrong. Brown's weakness heralds the sort of grand progressive
coalition/alliance that Tony imagined but was never able to attempt between Labour and the LDs. Brown
offering the referendum would be the first step toward that. In the case of the Tories falling short of an outright
majority in seats, they will respond as though Brown is acting illegitimately, which he would not be by
remaining as PM and dealing with Clegg. Informed people are already talking of what might begin to unfold on
Friday as &quot;Florida.&quot; The Tories, backed by the Murdoch press, will attempt to push Labour aside by force
majeure—something that will not succeed under those circumstances. The Murdochs are almost literally going

We need to work in reference and quotes from POTUS Nobel speech near the top. I haven't read it yet so not sure
what's most appriopriate. Since the speech alluded to some of the same ground, should we be explicit in asserting that
this speech further clarifies/expands/explains what this Admin means by human rights?

Signed by Pres. Toribiong a couple of hours ago after three days of negotiations that I conducted for Palau and DAS
Frankie Reed led for the US. These were the first real negotiations of the process -- a step (which Jake Sullivan helped
get taken) that was as needed as the changes in the US proposal they produced. Thanks for all that you did. It obtained
US objectives as well as resulted in substantially greater fairness for a former territory, now freely associated state. Jeff

    <body>PRISTINA (Reuters) - European Union-mediated talks between Belgrade and Pristina will begin only after a new Kosovo
government takes power following elections in February, Kosovo's acting president said. Last month Serbia, which does
not recognize Kosovo's independence, agreed to hold talks with Pristina after it was told its hardline stance on its former
province could halt progress to the EU. In an interview, acting President Jakup Krasniqi said it would be difficult to start
talks during a political crisis that followed President Fatmir Sejdiju's resignation last month. &quot;The first half of February is
the optimal time to hold early elections,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;The end of March is the period when Kosovo will have its
own institutions and then it can have talks with Serbia.&quot; Krasniqi said he will announce the date of early elections a day
or two after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visits Pristina. Kosovo had scheduled elections for November 2011,
but Sejdiju's resignation hurt relations between the two main coalition partners: the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK)
and Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK). Krasniqi said early elections could postpone the sale of Telekom, which is

Subject: Update on PSA
Wanted to update you all on the PSA and where things stand. The Ad Council placed the PSA on Wednesday.
Overall, based on the MNR report, our estimated online audience for the PSA launch story was 5.4 million, including
stories on Yahoo Finance, Forbes, and CNN. For just over 24 hours since the MNR distribution, this is fantastic pickup
per the Ad Council.
The Ad Council will continue to push this out domestically and giving us updates on where it is. They are targeting large
sporting events like U.S Open, etc. If you would like the full report with specific stories, I can send separately however
because the file is so large I do not want to max out everyone's inboxes.
On the International side and specifically S interest in placing with Al Jazeera, the Ad Council did a slightly modified
version of the 30 sec PSA, removing the texting information on the final screen and is overnighting the tape to the State
Department today. Once we have that (timing for Tuesday), we will work with Dana and PA to have the PSA placed

    <body>1. This draft, sent by separate email, is intended to give you options and ideas. Use as you
wish. Several ideas are at the core of this version: in particular, the concept of the US as a
modern global nation and how that serves our capacity for leadership.
2. For most policy speeches a generic tone and workmanlike prose are acceptable. But for
this one, it is not. This speech can't afford to be lackluster. It will then be held up in
invidious comparison to Obama's glittering best efforts. Your speech must have, amid the
policies, a distinctive and authoritative voice.
3. Your early draft makes no distinctions between allies or partners; indeed, it barely
mentions allies. The early draft also features a strong malaise theme. Even if rebutted
after being raised, the focus is on obstacles and hindrances, not on achievements,
opportunities and what can be achieved. There's no accounting of progress so far. The
effect is downbeat in tone. At the same time, the draft contains passages of vague and
gauzy liberal universalism, while in one line assailing it, an unconvincing juggling act.
The notion that all nations and peoples want the same things as Americans will not fly
and is open to derision. It reflects blithe liberal cultural imperialism, among other things.
(See Graham Greene. And, on the contrary, some nations—and peoples—seek nuclear
weapons, like Iran; some don't want to curb global warming, like China; some don't care
about human rights, like most Arab nations; some have contempt for democracy,
including de facto allies like Egypt, not to mention Myanmar; and some are indifferent to
poverty, any number of African kleptocracies.) Also there is some confusion of
definitions, for example, asserting dialogue with adversaries is &quot;strategic engagement,&quot;
when that is a concept usually applied to allies and partners.
4. The speech must be crafted with a sense of real time and cannot be delivered out of sync
with it. Slogans can become shopworn, especially those that lack analytical, historical
and descriptive power. What served you once, at your confirmation, may not serve again
in the same way. The most cogent foreign policy columnists from Clive Crook of the
Financial Times to David Rothkopf of Foreign Policy have already written columns in
the last week on the limits of &quot;soft power&quot; (i.e., &quot;smart power&quot;) and others I understand

Overall the speech is worth reading; if you like I'll have it put in your weekend book. 2 passages
particularly worth noting.
1. &quot;Across the Atlantic, Hilary Clinton has pledged to put women 'front and center' of the American development
agenda. That is the right choice. As David Cameron and Jeff Sachs argued earlier this year, women can hold the
key to development in the world's poorest countries — in education, enterprise, micro-finance and healthcare.
Investing in women pays dividends throughout the entire community.&quot;
2. &quot;I see DFID as a key, joined-up, integrated department, a bright star in the Whitehall constellation, a department
of state for development in the developing world. That's why DFID has a seat at the Cabinet table and it's why I
won't be satisfied until our message rings down the corridors of each and every department in Whitehall.&quot;
We obviously don't love the &quot;dept of state for development language,&quot; but what is most
noteworthy is his emphasis on &quot;joined-up&quot; and &quot;integrated&quot; dept — underlining the fact that

Jake, Joe,
Here is the update from 10 and PRM for the Secretary (as you recall she had met with the outgoing head of UNFPA):
Eric and I would like to update you on the Secretary-General's selection process of the next head of UNFPA.
Working closely with PRM and USUN, we gathered 22 names as possible candidates from various sources, including
NG0s, governments, and respected individuals in the health sector. We whittled down this list to three people who
have qualifications that we believe are necessary for the job: a deep understanding of and support for UNFPA's
reproductive health/family planning mission and its critical role in implementing the 1CPD Program of Action, strong
leadership and advocacy skills, and strong management ability to oversee an organization with over 2000 employees
worldwide.
We see the leading candidates as:
USUN concurs and is in touch with the SG's office to convey our views. The SG will make his own shortlist based on a UN
review panel's recommendations. He is expected to announce his selection in October to allow the designee some
overlap with the incumbent, Thoraya Obaid, whose term expires at the end of the year. We will keep you apprised as
the process continues.

LONDON, Aug 19 (Reuters) - A decision by the Scottish government whether to release a Libyan convicted of the 1988
Lockerbie bombing may be announced as early as Thursday, a legislator said on Wednesday. Christine Grahame, a
member of the Scottish Parliament who has campaigned against the conviction, said she expected former Libyan
intelligence agent Abdel Basset al-Megrahi to be freed early on compassionate grounds because he has terminal
cancer. The regional administration has come under pressure from the United States to keep Megrahi in jail, while a
British government minister said the wait for news was &quot;becoming embarrassing&quot;. &quot;I don't think it will be long coming,&quot;
Grahame told BBC radio. &quot;I suspect we might have something maybe tomorrow (Thursday) morning. We will probably go
for compassionate release. It avoids a lot of difficulties.&quot; Scotland's Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill is considering two

some interest, and the Australian CG in LA is very excited to make it happen. Consulate here has invited me to
speak at conference in January in LA on the US and Australia in Asia, and I have accepted (a good topic too if

    <body>Brazilian FM defends dialogue with Iran
BRASILIA, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said Tuesday Brazil would maintain negotiations
with Iran on uranium enrichment and oppose any sanctions against Iran.
Amorim said Brazil was against the production of nuclear weapons, but Iran had the right to carry out a peaceful nuclear
program.
&quot;Dialogue is still possible. What we want is to make sure (that the uranium will not be used to make weapons) through
peaceful ways and dialogue,&quot; Amorim told reporters.
Under a draft deal brokered by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN nuclear watchdog, most of Iran's
existing low-grade enriched uranium should be shipped to Russia and France, where it would be processed into fuel rods
with a purity of 20 percent.
Iran declared on Tuesday it had started the process of producing 20-percent enriched uranium inside the country.
In response to Iran's announcement, the U.S.-led Western countries have warned to take political and economic

Statement by the Secretary
The Death of Polish President Kaczynski and His Delegation
I join President Obama in offering my deepest condolences to the people of Poland, to the Kaczynski family, and to the
families of all those killed in this tragedy. Lost alongside President Kaczynski and his wife were Polish leaders from
across the political spectrum, men and women who shaped and sped Poland's post-1989 democratic transformation and
were leading Poland into its promising future. The tragedy of these lives cut short will be felt deeply across the world,
but their legacy will live on in a free and flourishing Poland.
The United States stands with the Polish people in this difficult hour. Like the country he led, President Kaczynski was
one of America's most valued and trusted allies. He was well known in the United States as a champion for democracy

FYI:
I have now seriously reviewed 9 candidates (and explored a handful of others who, for various reasons, I didn't feel
would be what we were looking for). Two have acceted other jobs that were already on the table before I spoke to
them (and for which they were better suited). One ( who I love) has decided her legal future requires her to come
here in a capacity other than speechwriting, and I think she's right about that
None of these candidates is over 32 years old. The best writer among them is the youngest — 24. She is intellectually
extremely mature and the only professional writer in the group.
On the other hand,
she's extremely smart and an excellent writer.
I have two more candidates who are working on second rounds of mock speeches. I need to see how quickly and
effectively they grasp directions and feedback. Hopefully one of them will work out for us.

It's a very New York crowd and very Diane style event (i.e. unconventional) Last year, it was held in one of the big
delegates' lounges at the UN and she redid all the chairs, etc in her patterns. The awards are all serious and DVF is the
moderator. Each awardee receives 50K for her ongoing work. The event bears no resemblance to a typical foreign policy

The Settlement Freeze That Never Was, And Never Will Be
On 07.05.10, By Max Blumenthal

Linda Forsell's June 21 photos of ongoing construction in the Israeli settlement of Har Homa expose the illusion of
Netanyahu's settlement freeze
With the Israeli settlement moratorium scheduled to expire on September 26, the right-wing parties in Israel's coalition
government are exerting maximum pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to block the policy's renewal. &quot;Let's
get rid of the freeze and get back to building,&quot; declared Israeli Minister of Public Affairs and the Diaspora Yuli Edelstein on
Israel National Radio yesterday. &quot;It's our land anyway!&quot; (Edelstein lives in the settlement of Neve Daniel).
Back in the US, the former Israel lobbyist and ex-Clinton Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk took to the Washington
Post's op-ed page to praise Netanyahu and Barack Obama for ensuring that &quot;there were zero building starts in the West
Bank settlements.&quot;
During the week of June 21, I traveled through the West Bank with Swedish photojournalist Linda Forsell to document
new settlement construction and the settlers' theft of water from Palestinian towns. Forsell took a series of photos at Har
Homa, a massive Israeli settlement towering over the Palestinian town of Beit Sarhour. Her photos show ongoing
construction of hundreds of new settlement units — documents of the settlement freeze sham.

Netanyahu authorized the building of new settlement units just days after he
announced the freeze in November 2009. He attempted to disguise new settlement construction by drawing a false
distinction between the West Bank and &quot;parts of Jerusalem&quot; like Har Homa that actually lie outside 1967 lines. As Israeli
government flack Mark Regev remarked in December 2009, &quot;We've made a clear distinction between the West Bank and
Jerusalem. Jerusalem is our capital and will stay as such.&quot; With a few exceptions, Obama allowed this scheme to go
forward.
According to the Washington Post, Obama's meeting with Netanyahu this week will have more to do with reassuring

I have to say that this argument that the Taliban are ok to ignore is dangerous morally and politically.
The argument at the time was that harboring terrorism was the same as launching terrorism and that those who
harbored would be held responsible. This also had long term deterrence value against regimes that would outsource the
dirty work.
To now even consider giving the Taliban a pass after harboring terrorists who committed direct attacks on new York and
Washington defies the imagination. This wasn't some embassy bombing but a strike right at our country. The white
house or congress barely escaped destruction. Saddam Hussein wasn't connected to al Qaeda but the Taliban surely
were without question.
And Teheran and north Korea are watching carefully, gauging how much resolve the us has in stopping their plans. If the
us lets the Taliban off the hook then they certainly can conclude it will do nothing beyond sanctions with them. And
essentially letting karzai twist in the wind also suggests the us does not live up to it's commitments, giving pause to
those who would help the us.

INR is working with the interagency to create six initial country pages (Indonesia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and
Yemen) on this website. In addition to background information about each country and its relationship with the United
States, each page will focus on providing up to date information on how local audiences view the United States and an
analysis of the mediums through which local audiences get their news. Pages will also include a list effective messaging
themes that would resonate with target audiences in each country.
In the coming weeks, INR will be receiving interagency feedback on these initial draft web pages, and will be seeking
guidance as to which additional countries should be covered. The hope is that each page will evolve over time based on

If it would be useful, I would be happy to convene a small, private discussion with some of the sharpest people in the
group, or give you some names.
A few observations following up our call this am.:
(1) This (a Framework Agreement) is very difficult but I don't think impossible. If Bibi can say he has secured
unprecedented commitments on security and established the principle of a Jewish state, he could decide to
play the historic leader. If he is uncompromising, he will have to deal with the consequences for US-Israeli
relations. His opt out, of course, is to blame the Pais, but we will be &quot;in the room&quot;.
(2) I think this should be a negotiation that goes from principle to paper rather than the other way around, i.e. not
an early exchange of documents that dig each side into its positions. The two leaders need to feel each
other out first at the level of first principles, to be distilled after a period by the U.S.
(3) Not sure we need to be in every meeting.. Ultimately, they need to establish some trust. But we (you or
Mitchell) need to be present enough to make sure that there is no misunderstanding of what has been
agreed, and to move things along. .
(4) On the critical issue of security, I don't think the Israelis any more trust NATO to stand firm. They will expect
an IDF presence in the Jordan Valley for some time. Palestinians recognize that there will be a transitional
phase. Question is how long.
(5) As you know, Abbas' position is crumbling. Based on my conversation with him when he was here recently, I
think he is genuinely committed to an agreement. He hopes that, if this fails, Bibi will seem to be

gallbladder surgery. In 1974, Murtha became the first combat veteran of the Vietnam War elected to Congress. He

Sid,
Could you please pass the following to HRC. Thanks. Joe
Dear Madame Secretary,
When we last spoke at the Corporate Council on Africa you were kind enough to invite me to pay a call on you when in
DC. As it turns out, I will be in Washington for most of next week, arriving the afternoon of the 16th and returning to Santa
Fe the evening of the 201h ( the return is flexible if you were available to see me over the weekend.) I realize that you are
traveling this week and possibly into next, but I wanted to reach out to you. As I wrote to you earlier, I am a director for
Symbion Power and may soon assume more direct responsibility for all of Africa as Symbion expands there from its
current operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Symbion's competitive advantage is its reliance on local partnering and
human capacity development in the execution of its projects. Its success in the most difficult and dangerous
environments has been very impressive, as the four minute video that Sid gave to you on my behalf demonstrates. We
now want to bring that business model and philosophy to Africa where the social entrepreneurship and the development
of skilled labor is imperative for Africa's long term economic prospects, as you have so forcefully articulated in past
comments.
am very enthusiastic about Symbion. It is one or
the very few American companies outside the petroleum sector willing to establish itself and to undertake projects in
Africa. With our record of success elsewhere, we are certain that our approach to project development and execution will
mesh nicely with African needs and U.S. policy priorities.
Valerie, Trevor and Samantha join me in extending our best wishes to you, Bill, and Chelsea as we enter the holiday
season.
Joe
Ambassador Joseph Wilson

You'll be happy to know that the Secretary's video message was the subject of a great op-ed in today's Thai
Rath the leading newspaper in Thailand. They took exactly the line that we hoped they would — seeing her
message not as the U.S. intervening in politics, but, rather, as a very personal message from someone who
cares deeply about Thailand. The writer even referred to the Secretary's autobiography.
Thai Rath (leading Thai language daily), a commentary on Thai politics, April 16, referenced
Secretary Clinton's video statement calling for a peaceful solution to Thailand's political crisis: &quot;I
would like to thank U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for making a request herself and on behalf
of President Obama for the two opposing parties to return to the negotiating table so as to end their
conflict. The short video message in which she mentioned Thailand was full of sincerity. She started
by saying that she was making this request as &quot;a long-standing friend of the Thai people&quot; She
referred to the Songkran festival which is the Thai New Year and said the opposing parties should
consider this an opportunity for a new round of talks. She emphasized that violence cannot bring
happiness and peace and that the opposing parties should talk in order to solve the problem. I
believe Mrs. Clinton said this with sincerity. I have read a book in which she wrote about her brief

Hillary and Cheryl,
I'm feeling very good about our recent efforts to connect our speeches thematically. We've done it with development,
human rights, and Internet freedom; and most recently with AIPAC, Ctr for Middle East Peace, and next the AJC. Here's
what I want to suggest: The three most basic elements of human existence are food, water, and health. We have now
done major speeches on food and water. I'd like us to consider a major speech on global health —the third in a
trilogy. Linking these three issues thematically, we can explain how and why foreign policy challenges and solutions

    <body>Subject message from Jerry Hauer re Haiti coordindation
Jerry, as you may recall, was Guiliani's homeland security guy in NYC and became B6
one of the world's experts. He also worked for Clinton Admn and helped with disaster relief (including earthquakes)
around the world. He called me today with some suggestions (some of which may be moot), so I asked him to put them
into a memo. Here it is, for what it's worth:
I think the fundamental issue is that no one seems to be in charge and no
one person has been tasked with trying to pull all of the pieces together
into a short term and long term plan. Obviously in the short term, search
and rescue and food and water are the main priorities. There seems to be
little communication between the various areas where people have congregated
and a central command post where agencies can call or radio for additional
supplies including food, water and medical.
I don't recommend DoD be put in charge of this. They rarely have the kind of
touch that brings together all the necessary agencies under one roof. I
would set up a central command that has representatives from all federal
agencies in one place. There is no reason things should be this
disorganized. I would break the island into grids and assign one person to
be the coordinator for each of the grids. That person will be responsible
for all activities within their grid and will report activities to the
island on-scene coordinator. We should get a radio company like Motorola to
set up temporary towers and give the State Department several hundred radios
so everyone involved in the response is able to communicate with the command
post and with each other.
I think one of the most important roles for DoD is to provide security for
the rescue teams and medical teams. They also should be responsible for the
operation of the airport, for off loading planes and for scheduling all
incoming flights so there is no lost time waiting for planes to land. I also
think DoD should be responsible for airlifting supplies that are requested
by each one of the grid coordinators. Additionally, the helicopters should
be used to move critical patients to the hospital ship on the way and to the
aircraft carrier currently on station. At least once a day, the coordinator
assigned by the President and the Secretary of State should be responsible
for getting situation reports from all agencies on site, particularly
regarding food and water, security, medical and search and rescue.
The lack of command and control is allowing the situation to become more
chaotic rather than more coordinated. I believe that if the Secretary were
to talk to the other nations involved through the UN, they would be
supportive of better coordination.
Bottom line is that there is no order to the operation and you need strong
people in there who can speak on behalf of the President and the Secretary

    <body>Blast in Lahore; many casualties
LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) A powerful bomb exploded in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore on Wednesday,
ripping buildings apart and causing many casualties, according to officials and television footage.
The mid-morning blast occurred the office of the emergency police service in main business district of Lahore.
The nearby office of Pakistan's main intelligence agency was also badly damaged.
&quot;There is a large number of casualties,&quot; local government official Khoro Pervaiz told Dawn news channel.
Sporadic gunfire was heard in the area of the blast, and troops rushed to the scene.
Television footage taken shortly after the blast showed emergency workers carrying at least one body covered
by a blanket to an ambulance, and injured bystanders mopping blood from wounds.
The blast comes as government forces are engaged in a major offensive against Taliban militants who have
seized control of the northwestern Swat Valley.

With some 20 seats still undecided, Republicans have already picked up 61 seats in House; Democrats likely to

election's impact on our oversight committees. Murkowski appears to be headed for historic write-in win; her
support of Law of Sea and likely sympathy for New START will be good for us. Reid will likely return to
Washington energized by win to pursue consequential lame duck session. Manchin and Kirk will take up their
seats in the Senate this month; Rich suggests S calls to each to help lock in support for New START.

Tom Nides' prep going well, and he'll see SFRC members and Sem Gilibrand this week. Rich expects

    <body>Lowey to Remove Assistance for Afghanistan From Foreign Aid Bill
Chairwoman Announces Oversight Hearings on Corruption in Afghanistan
WASHINGTON — In light of two troubling news reports on corruption within the Afghan government, Congresswoman
Nita Lowey (D-NY), Chairwoman of the Appropriations State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee, today announced
she is removing funding for Afghanistan beyond humanitarian aid from her 2011 bill scheduled for markup this week.
&quot;The alleged shipment of billions in donor funds out of Afghanistan and allegations of Afghan government insiders
impeding corruption investigations are outrageous,&quot; said Lowey. &quot;I do not intend to appropriate one more dime for
assistance to Afghanistan until I have confidence that U.S. taxpayer money is not being abused to line the pockets of
corrupt Afghan government officials, drug lords, and terrorists. Furthermore, the government of Afghanistan must
demonstrate that corruption is being aggressively investigated and prosecuted.
&quot;Rampant corruption fosters the conditions that threaten the security of our troops and the stability of the Afghan
government and economy.&quot;
The State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee will mark up its Fiscal Year 2011 Appropriations Act on
Wednesday June 30th. The subcommittee will not consider any bilateral assistance for the Afghan government other
than lifesaving humanitarian aid at this time.

Ms. Cheryl Mills
Counselor &amp; Chief of Staff
Department of State
Dear Chief of Staff,
Following our short exchange of views, on the margins of your last meeting with the African
Diplomatic Group on Food Security, and yesterday's press release on Secretary of State's visit to
Africa, I wish to express my deepest appreciation for your personal support in the positive
consideration of the invitation the Cape Verdian Minister of Foreign Affairs extended to Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton.
The Cape Verdian authorities see this visit as an important landmark in the bilateral relations between
Cape Verde and the US and an opportunity to discuss ways to strenghten those relations and our
cooperation at the international level where we share various views and goals. We therefore look
forward to the visit with much enthusiasm.
In this line, I wish to reiterate that the Embassy of Cape Verde and myself stand ready to facilitate
and contribute in any way deemed necessary to ensure an adequate preparation of the visit.
Please feel free to contact me at my following e-mails:

Subject: Problem: Bustan Plan
The Jerusalem city council is set to review the Kings Garden/Gan Hamelech/Bustan plan tomorrow. Recall that the plan
received approval by a municipal sub committee in late June. The entire city council must now review and approve the
plan because of an administrative appeal filed against it by a Meretz city council member (this appeal process requires
that the entire city council review the plan at some point.) Lots of other details here that Jerusalem will be including in a
front channel cable. Amanda Pilz, CCed here, drafted.
Bottom line though is that (1) this is on the agenda at the explicit direction of the Mayor and deputy mayor and (2)
there is no statutory or other need for this review tomorrow.
Also note that this is not the final step in the process. After full Jerusalem municipal approval the plan must go to

Huma,
As I mentioned to you both before, told me in our interview a couple of weeks ago that she was now B5
only interested in two jobs, both of which are out of reach: B6
and (name in play). I tried to interest her in other things at State and USAID,
but she also insists on SES status, which further limits her options given the freeze on SES positions at State. She didn't
seem interested in at any level.
She left saying that she was very disappointed that she hadn't gotten one of her two top preferences and that maybe
she should just stay in her current job, which she loves and which gives her much more money and status than we can
offer. Given her original aspirations for an Under or Assistant Secretary position, I can't imagine that she'd be happy as
for instance, if one were to open up. But let me know if you think she'd be more flexible in the
end.

New blow for Conservative alliance with UUP
as assembly member quits party
Alan McFarland follows MP Lady Hermon in resigning from Ulster Unionists to sit as independent
• Henry McDonaid, Ireland correspondent
• gi,;ardian.co.uk, Wednesday 31 March 2010 09.48 BST
The ConseNatives' alliance with the Ulster Unionists has sustained a second blow in North Down after last week's
resignation of the sitting MP Lady Hermon.
Assembly member and former army major Alan McFarland announced today that he was leaving the UUP in protest at its
pact with the Tories.
It is expected McFarland will now work for Herman's re-election as an independent against the official UUP-Tory
candidate.
A UUP statement said the timing of McFarland's announcement was &quot;disappointing&quot;. He has been a UUP member of the
Stormont assembly for 12 years and was once a loyal ally of Lord Trimble, Nprthem Irelard's former first minister.
Trimble has been one of the driving forces behind the UUP-Conservative alliance.
Last night McFarland resigned his membership of the party and said he would now sit as an independent member of the
assembly.

Please Pass to the Secretary
Madame Secretary,
A shoot out occurred on August 20 in front of the American School in Monterrey (AFSM), resulting in the death of two
bodyguards. An investigation is continuing into the details, but our understanding at this point is that it was an
attempted kidnapping targeting the relatives of a local business executive. While it does not appear that U.S. families
were targeted, the sharp increase in kidnapping incidents in the Monterrey area, and this event in particular, present a
very high risk to the families of U.S. citizens who might be become incidental victims.
U.S. security and law enforcement personnel have engaged local and federal security officials to seek their help on
understanding the immediate risks and measures that can be taken. I have urged U.S. families at the Consulate in
Monterrey not to send their children to school in the coming days while we review the events that took place on August
20. We also are advising U.S. citizens in the area that we have urged Consulate personnel not to send their children to
school while we complete this security review.
I am sure that the warden notice will lead to a rash of press reports on U.S. concerns about security in Monterrey. More
broadly, if the government cannot get the kidnappings in Monterrey under control, that may affect our ability to

3 militants die on eve of Afghan presidential vote
KABUL (AP) Police stormed a bank in Kabul on Wednesday and killed three insurgents who had taken it over, while a
wave of attacks killed at least six election workers around the country on the eve of the presidential election, officials
said. The three-man assault in Kabul came a day after two militant attacks in the capital, including rockets fired at the
presidential palace. It also follows a suicide car bomb explosion in front of NATO's Kabul headquarters Saturday that
killed seven, a drumbeat of attacks that would appear to signal the intent of Taliban insurgents and their militant allies
to disrupt Thursday's vote. In a sign of how difficult election preparations have been, Afghanistan's chief electoral
officer said that 20 percent of election materials hadn't yet been delivered to voting sites less than 24 hours before polls

Political - Philippe is supposed to be preparing a end of year document - both accomplishments and how to get

Foreign Policy - we have a tenative list from Michael Fuchs i will email to you - it still needs work. We did not
discuss 21st century and beyond so that frame still needs to be established
Look forward to bureaucracy movement follow-up discussion - also need to download on related challenges

Further to our earlier alert, the press is widely reporting Somali gunmen disguised in army uniforms stormed a hotel

no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.
The African Union confirmed at least 15 people were killed in the attack on the Huna Hotel, in a government-controlled
neighborhood between the presidential palace and the Indian Ocean. It did not say whether the dead were all MPs.

    <body>Palestinian president calls Israeli counterpart to offer Rosh Hashanah greetings; Peres urges Abbas not to abandon
peace talks.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called President Shimon Peres to offer greetings for the Jewish holiday of Rosh
Hashanah. During the telephone conversation, Peres pleaded with Abbas to &quot;trust [Prime Minister Benjamin]
Netanyahu.&quot;
Against the backdrop of recently relaunched direct peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, Peres urged
the Palestinian president &quot;not to abandon the talks before peace is achieved. There is no one more suited than you to
achieve peace for your people, and for the entire region.&quot;
Abbas and other senior Palestinian negotiators have threatened to quit the U.S.-backed negotiations if Israel should
resume construction in West Bank settlements. Last November, Netanyahu declared a 10-month moratorium on
construction in settlements, but the freeze is set to expire at the end of this month, and it is not yet clear whether it will
be renewed.
&quot;Even if things don't appear perfect,&quot; Peres told Abbas, &quot;the path toward peace and an independent Palestinian state is

    <body>(Haaretz) Netanyahu urges top ministers to extend settlement freeze
PM to convene inner cabinet on Tuesday for vote on a 60-day moratorium in exchange for U.S. guarantees.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will convene his forum of top ministers on Tuesday afternoon to debate extending
Israel's moratorium on construction in West Bank settlements for 60 days.
The concession would be made in exchange for a series of reported U.S. guarantees in Israel's direct peace negotiations
with the Palestinians. Israel halted construction temporarily for 10 months, a freeze that ended on September 26.
The Palestinians have said they would not continue the recently renewed negotiations unless Israel agreed to halt
construction again. The Obama administration has urged Israel to reconsider its refusal of that demand.
If Netanyahu succeeds in convincing the Forum of Seven to accept an extension of the construction freeze, he plans to
bring the matter to the political-security cabinet for a vote later Tuesday.
Defense Minister Ehud Barak (Labor) and Intelligence and Atomic Energy Minister Dan Meridor (Likud) are expected to
support Netanyahu's position, while Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman (Yisrael Beiteinu) is likely to present the
greatest opposition.
Netanyahu is pinning his hopes now on Ministers Benny Begin (Likud), Moshe Ya'alon (Likud) and Eli Yishai (Shas). The

Depdg on amount, they get on the big wall of contributors, we show multiple scenes of NYC in the shows and displays,
they can use the wonderful VIP lounge/auditorium to have NYC day or week at the Expo - the rockettes, Broadway goes
to China, commercial diplomacy, mtgs betwn NYC and Chinese officials, .getting SME's access to China etc. We could
really be creative.

While it has improved, it has also grown in length. It is now just a bit shorter than your Senate confirmation

Subject: Cuba
You will have seen Verma's note regarding Senator Menedez desire to speak to S re direct mail talks with Cuba and our
follow on talks with the Cubans and dissidents. He is upset tha he was not consulted and does not think he was briefed
sufficiently quickly.
WHA and H had briefed immediately on the direct mail talks, and had briefed HFAC on the follow on talks. We had
asked for time to brief SFRC but had not yet done so.
This should be a good news story. We engaged with the Cubans at the Vice-Minister level, breaking a several year
shunning of our Interest Section by the Cubans, traveled outside of Havana to view hurricane damage (thus breaking
through the barrier of no travel beyond a ten-mile perimeter), we pursued extradition of US fugitives in Cuba, and most
importantly, Bisa Williams (my DAS and the head of delegation) met with a broad range of dissidents, civil socity reps,
and bloggers.

Subject: Guy was right!
Stewart,
I went for news and indeed Guy is right. The meeting occurred yesterday and the decision was made to revoke
the government on October 29. I wonder what happened with the initial decision which was strictly concerning
Minister Dorsainvil and which was for November 20th or 21st.The idea had been sold that Michele should not be
touched as the President did not care to have a vacuum in these electoral times. Plus, Michele was finally
regarded as ambitionless (not seeking presidential powers) which is not a bad thing under the
circumstances. Apparently, she, not being amenable to sacrificing some of her Ministers... and again, she being
the one to name their replacements, has brought about the decision to do away with her altogether. The trouble
is that nobody seems willing to counter the President with whom the instructions have originated. It is a head to
head.match between the Prime Minister and the President. That is obviously not good. Nobody will stand
against the President elect for the Prime Minister appointed.
I will have two meetings with separate parliamentarians tomorrow. On one end the ones voting to oust her on
the other the week opposition. The frustrating thing is that none have allegiance to her, just as none have the
individual power to stand against the vote for which consensus is being secured.

Jake —
Here is an update for the Secretary on the status of the non-finance components of the G-20 Seoul Summit
declaration. Sherpa, Finance Deputy, and Working Group discussions are ongoing on the financial issues (and
the text is very close hold) — so we don't have much on that. The following represents what is likely to be close
to the final outcome on the other issues.
• Fossil Fuel Subsidies: The text will reaffirm the Pittsburgh Summit commitment to phase out over the
medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. It will also take up the issue of fuel price volatility; this
portion will focus on improving the quality of fuel data (inventories, storage capacity, refining, etc.) and
greater dialogue between fuel producers and consumers.
• Climate Change: The G-20 will rededicate their efforts to discuss climate change issues under the
UNFCCC process with the aim of reaching a global and comprehensive framework post 2012. The text
will also focus on the upcoming COP16 conference in Mexico.
• Trade: The G-20 will continue to collectively push for the conclusion of the Doha Round, calling for
intensified engagement in 2011.
• Development: The Communiqué will contain a multi-year development action plan that focuses on nine
pillars: infrastructure, human resource development, trade, private investment and job creation, food
security, financial inclusion, fiscal integrity and domestic resource mobilization, and &quot;growth with
resilience.&quot;
• Anti-Corruption: The G-20 will endorse an Anti-Corruption Action Plan to spur action under the UN
Convention Against Corruption; address transnational bribery; deny corrupt persons access to the global
financial system; and further engage the private sector.
I will be happy to provide more details on any one of these items if the Secretary would like — and will report
on the discussions and final outcome.

G.O.P. Support for Arms Treaty

Another Republican senator signaled Tuesday that he may vote for the new arms control treaty with Russia if it comes
up for a vote before the Senate adjourns for the year later this month.
Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, who did not run for re-election, said he hopes that the Senate will get a chance
to vote on the treaty, known as New Start, right after a deal on tax cuts and a spending resolution to keep the
government operating.
&quot;Start is an important issue. It should be fully debated. I am leaning towards supporting it,&quot; he told Andrea Mitchell on
MSNBC. &quot;I haven't made a final decision,&quot; he added, noting that Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the lead Republican

Subject: (WSJ)- German government awaits outcome of GM board of directors meeting
BERLIN (Dow Jones)--The German government is awaiting the outcome of a meeting of General Motors Co.'s board of
directors later Friday that will discuss the sale of its German unit Adam Opel GmbH.
The government will then assess what it believes will be a fundamental signal on which of the two remaining bids for the
unit the company favors, economics ministry spokeswoman Beatrix Brodkorb said Friday.
The meeting is due to take place in the afternoon, central European time, according to the government.
Austrian-Canadian car parts maker Magna International Inc. (MGA), in a consortium with Russian savings banks OAO
Sberbank (SBER.RS), and Belgian private equity firm RHJ International SA (RHJI.BT) have recently presented revised
bids for Opel and its sister company, U.K.-based Vauxhall.
Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is keen to rescue jobs at Opel ahead of the Sept. 27 general election, has
lobbied hard for Magna to be win the bid, while GM in the past has preferred RHJ.
Government spokesman Klaus Vater said Friday that there is currently &quot;some movement,&quot; and Brodkorb said the
government has been in contact with the U.S. on Opel over the past 24 hours.
Brodkorb stressed that Germany's offer to provide the entire EUR4.5 billion in state aid for Opel came after GM asked
Germany to provide more details on aid for the Magna bid but made no request for more state aid details for RHJ.
The offer to pay state subsidies entirely and upfront without other European countries that have Opel and Vauxhall plants
&quot;is an offer to other countries to help get a fast decision,&quot; Brodkorb said.
Other European countries with Opel plants include Spain, the U.K., Poland and Belgium.
The U.K. government is reportedly irritated by Germany's offer to entirely shoulder state guarantees of up to EUR4.5
billion in the deal because a decision on state aid wouldn't be up to Germany alone since the Opel bids also involve

I'm feeling very good about our recent efforts to connect our speeches thematically. We've done it with development,
human rights, and Internet freedom; and most recently with AIPAC, Ctr for Middle East Peace, and next the AJC. Here's
what I want to suggest: The three most basic elements of human existence are food, water, and health. We have now
done major speeches on food and water. I'd like us to consider a major speech on global health — the third in a trilogy.

Cheryl, I'd appreciate your passing this note to Secretary Clinton. I'd rather not have this idea swirling around in email

VAN SUSTEREN: Senator, there is a report from the State Department that Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton will testify on Benghazi before the middle of January. There has been some criticism of whether or
not she has a concussion. I believe she has a concussion. What do you think?
MCCAIN: I know that in my view, Secretary Clinton, when she said she assumed full responsibility, she
certainly has a lot of responsibility for what happened in Benghazi. That's -- that report made that very
clear. But I must say, I have never seen Secretary Clinton ,back down from a fight. And I
have
never seen her back down. And I believe that she is now not physically well enough to testify
and She will testify the middle of January.

I have asked Jose to get you a more detailed report but I must tell you the opening of the USA Pavilion has been a great
success so far - at least among the expo-goers. A few vignettes.
- while we don't want to brag to our Chinese hosts, our Pavilion has become the most popular. During the trial runs last
week, the Chinese expo-goers rushed directly from the gates to the USAP (and even broke some of our turn-styles).
Needless to say, the Chinese have improved security. On EACH of the first two days, 30,000 pple visited. Lines are long
and pple are loving the show. We are also getting many foreign officials to visit.
- the 100 US college student ambassadors (who act as guides and speak Mandarin) are the biggest hits of the pavilion.
Fair-goers stand in line to have their photo's taken w them. They explain the show and send a great message.
- the story line that we thght was simplistic is quite popular (the overture where Americans try to say hello in mandarin
is met w howls of laughter and Act II called the Garden is doing well). During the thunderstorm scene a mist comes from
the ceiling and some pple put up their umbrellas. Act I is a bit too commercial but the audience claps and take photo's
when you and President come on the screen.
- we are selling tons of USA merchandise - the two most popular items - mini-basketballs with the USAP seal on it and
the bison stuffed animals - who knew?
Anyway, thght u'd enjoy the quick report. I cannot imagine us not being here! We will keep you posted.
Smart power works!

Fri, 04/10/2009 - 5:56pm
Washington foreign policy hands in and out of the administration say that Maria Otero is likely to be
nominated to be under secretary of state for democracy and global affairs, or &quot;G&quot;. The Bolivian-born Otero is
president and CEO of Accion International and a member of the board of the Clinton Global Initiative, and is an
expert on sustainable microfinance with an interest in global women's issues, a key interest of Secretary
Clinton.
Former State Department counselor Wendy Sherman is being discussed for high level posts. Among them, the
Asia expert, Albright Group principal, and close Hillary Clinton advisor is being discussed as a candidate for
under secretary of state for economic affairs, now that Lael Brainard has gone to the Treasury Department, and
as a possible nominee to be uS, ambassador to China. (Update: and USAID administrator.)
Former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Carlos Pascual has been reported likely to be nominated to be Obama's
ambassador to Mexico. While some reports have suggested that Pascual, now vice president and director of
foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution, authored a paper describing Mexico as a failed state;think

    <body>Congratulations on the speech. I think it came out great. And the reaction I have heard today has been very
positive.
Let raise an idea about how you could present the arrangement on settlements that you are seeking with Israel as
I understand it, i.e. a moratorium coupled with allowances to complete a number of housing units. There are
two ways:
1. To describe it as an agreement, explaining why the US has accepted an Israeli completion of a
handful of units whose construction already has begun. This raises some concerns. It would
represent U.S. legitimization of some (however small) Israeli activity in the West Bank and it
would trigger Arab and Palestinian complaints that we had compromised, sowing doubts about
our effectiveness.
2. The alternative would be for the administration to say:
a. We have come a very long way, as Israel has made unprecedented commitments to the U.S. in terms of a
settlements freeze. This is a very welcome development.
b. We did not achieve all that we had hoped as Israel intends to complete a number of
housing units. We have differences with the Israeli government on this matter which we
have expressed to them..
•c. That said, we are convinced that substantial progress has been made that warrants
an immediate resumption of peace talks as well as Arab steps toward Israel that will help

    <body>This memo does not address specific policy initiatives.
What I've written are options. Use what you like, or none at all. Here are some ideas:
1. Hold Bibi's feet to the fire, remind everyone he was at Wye, his key participant event in
the peace process, and that it was successful.
2. Reassure all players of our commitment to the process and the solution (whatever the
language is).
3. Perhaps most controversial, I would argue something you should do is that, while
praising AIPAC, remind it in as subtle but also direct a way as you can that it does not
have a monopoly over American Jewish opinion. Bibi is stage managing US Jewish
organizations (and neocons, and the religious right, and whomever else he can muster)
against the administration. AIPAC itself has become an organ of the Israeli right,
specifically Likud. By acknowledging J Street you give them legitimacy, credibility and
create room within the American Jewish community for debate supportive of the
administration's pursuit of the peace process. Just by mentioning J Street in passing,
AIPAC becomes a point on the spectrum, not the controller of the spectrum. I suggest a
way how to do this below.
Some language:
1. On US national security interest, Israel's security and the peace process:
The reason the US has always supported Israel since the moment President Harry S. Truman
decided to recognize the State of Israel is that it is in the US national security interest and
consistent with our values. It is in our interest to support a thriving democracy in the Middle East

and in peace, he fought for what he knew was right, even when it was unpopular. He was a fierce advocate for working

the course of more than three decades in Congress, he became one of our nation's most respected voices on national

Thanks a lot for all the good wishes you have sent via Lois. It has been one of the pleasures of the last few months to see
you going from strength to strength. And the wedding looked fantastic!
Your message on Saturday was poignant. Losing is tough. When you win the party members and MPs doubly so. (When
it's your brother...). But I am so proud of the campaign we ran, the issues we raised etc. We got people to believe in a
New Labour platform - and modernised the platform.
I have announced today that I will stay in Parliament but not in shadow cabinet.
Thanks for all your encouragement over the last couple of years. I will let you know when I am in DC.

I will forward Hugo's latest note. As Monty Python would say, &quot;It's not dead yet.&quot;
Big fight over forming national unity government. Both sides taking maximalist positions, and our friends in the region are
not helping. Rio Group statement emboldened Zelaya and caused the de factos to dig in.
We might need S and Secretary Solis to call Zelaya and convince him to participate in forming the unity government.

Re: How's the weekend gone?
On my way home. The conference was a big success. I met with Cherie Blair on the gender gap in cell phones -
technology that may be even be more tramsformative than microcredit. Phil was with GSMA for the release of their
study so we're going to figure out how we van get industry on board, etc. Cherie was involved in the GSMA study as well.
We'll both be at CGI retreat later this week where we'll raise it as well. She sends her love.
The conference referenced you over and over. Dr Mukwege personally thanked you for your leadership. Some ofthe
congolese women parliamentarians want to see if they can raise theirvoices to some good end the way the Liberians did.
We will see what we can do to help them.
DVF had an incredible awards ceremony last night. Our Haitian activist got one of the 50K prizes. DVF went on and on
about how your leadership was really responsible for the evening and what it represented.The awardees all mentioned
you. I talked to last night. I think we can get. him to fund college scolarships for afghan women.
Another awardee was one of our afghan women who's bldg schools.
I can't thank you enuf for Friday. I thought your legacy was manifested in every way.
BTW, Paul Charron was there last night and sends his best. He's such a good guy.
I'm heading home exhausted but gratified by what we've been able to do.

pilot didn't say how he advocates changing the government in the repressive and secretive dictatorship. McCain said he
was not suggesting military action against the North. He said the Chinese, the DPRK's closest ally, should rein in its

high because of a recent attack by the North, or the world stage. &quot;The key to this, obviously, is China,&quot; McCain said on

    <subject>Quartet statement</subject>
    <body>Below is the final text of the Quartet statement, which Lavrov, Ban, and Ashton have now agreed to release *without a
call.* Sounds like your discussion with Lavrov did the trick:
The Quartet re-affirms that the current situation in Gaza, including the humanitarian and human rights situation of the
civilian population, is unsustainable, unacceptable, and not in the interests of any of those concerned. The Quartet
reiterates its call for a solution that addresses Israel's legitimate security concerns, including an end to weapons
smuggling into Gaza; promotes Palestinian unity based on the Palestine Liberation Organization commitments and the
reunification of Gaza and the West Bank under the legitimate Palestinian Authority; and ensures the unimpeded flow of
humanitarian aid, commercial goods and persons to and from Gaza, consistent with United Nations Security Council
resolution 1860 (2009). The Quartet declares its readiness to work closely with Israel, the Palestinian Government and
international donors in order to achieve sustainable economic development on the basis of the full implementation of
the Agreement on Access and Movement of 2005 and in the broader perspective of the two-state solution.
Consistent with these objectives, the Quartet and the Quartet Representative have worked with Israel, as well as
consulting the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, and other concerned parties, to effect a fundamental change in policy in
Gaza. The new policy towards Gaza just announced by the Government of Israel is a welcome development. The Quartet
notes that the elaboration of further details and modalities of implementation will be important in ensuring the
effectiveness of the new policy. Full and effective implementation will comprise a significant shift in strategy towards
meeting the needs of Gaza's population for humanitarian and commercial goods, civilian reconstruction and
infrastructure, and legitimate economic activity as well as the security needs of Israel. The Quartet will continue to work
with Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and other concerned parties to ensure these arrangements are implemented as
quickly as possible. The Quartet affirms that much work remains to achieve fully the solution stated above, and, in
consultation with the concerned parties, it will monitor closely the implementation of the policy in all its aspects. It will
actively explore additional ways to improve the situation in Gaza, encourage involvement of the PA at the crossings and
promote greater commerce between the West Bank and Gaza.
The Quartet stresses the importance of United Nations and other international interventions, as well as the work of local
non-governmental organizations, to be expanded in Gaza to meet urgent civilian needs, and calls on all parties to fully
enable this work.
The Quartet recognizes that Israel has legitimate security concerns that must continue to be safeguarded, and believes
efforts to maintain security while enabling movement and access for Palestinian people and goods are critical. The
Quartet commits to work with Israel and the international community to prevent the illicit trafficking of arms and
ammunition into Gaza. It urges all those wishing to deliver goods to do so through established channels so that their
cargo can be inspected and transferred via land crossings into Gaza. The Quartet emphasizes that there is no need for
unnecessary confrontations and calls on all parties to act responsibly in meeting the needs of the people of Gaza.
The Quartet also calls for an end to the deplorable detention of Gilad Shalit in advance of the fourth anniversary of his
capture on June 25; it further condemns the violation of Hamas' international obligation to provide him access by the
International Committee of the Red Cross and demands that Hamas immediately remedy the situation.
The Quartet also reiterates its support for proximity talks toward the resumption, without pre-conditions, of direct

    <body>Steve Mull is proposing that you do a conference call with the E3 FMs and Ashton sometime this week. Here is the
rationale and background:
The European Union Foreign Affairs Council, comprised of all 27 EU Foreign Ministers, will next meet on May 10. In a
conversation April 26, Bill Burns persuaded the E3 and European Commission to support adding to the agenda of that
meeting a discussion of preparations for the sanctions the EU will impose following passage of a UNSCR.
The European Council, comprised of the EU's heads of government, will meet on June 16-17 — a meeting which could
direct the imposition of such sanctions if we succeed in passing an UNSCR by then.

Subject: Ecuador Stop
As we discussed in the trip meeting-- I feel that we might miss an important opportunity if we don't try to fit Ecuador
into the Andean trip (Venezuela and Bolivia are out of the question). We could stop in Ecuador by leaving Peru early
Tuesday morning after the OAS GA. The Secretary could deliver her speech in Ecuador, visit w the President and arrive in
Colombia in the late afternoon. Delivering the speech in Quito would avoid upstaging the OASGA FMs in Lima.
The visit to Ecuador would advance already positive areas of cooperation, as well as underscore our desire to see Correa
succeed in achieving constructive institutional reform, while respecting and preserving democratic governance. Correa's
promise to reform Ecuador's political system and address social inequities resonates with a public disillusioned by
decades of corruption and political instability. His agenda is principally driven by nationalism, not anti-Americanism, and
although some of his economic policies mirror those of Venezuela, he is not following a recipe laid down by Chavez.
Despite its rhetoric, the Correa government has cooperated closely with the USG in many areas, including counter
narcotics, anti-corruption, and alternative development assistance. Although Ecuador can be a challenging partner, our
efforts to engage constructively with him are paying off. We had an excellent conversation during my April visit to
Quito, including an open and candid conversation on sensitive issues like freedom of the press and maintaining a
constructive dialogue with civil society. (The gift I gave him for his birthday, an edition of Living History signed by the
Secretary, had a strong positive impact on him. He said that his mother-- who lived much of her life in California is a
great admirer of the Secretary. ) Reporting after my meetings in Quito was very positive and seemed to indicate that
Correa is ready to move beyond the stale rhetoric surrounding the Colombia Defense Cooperation Agreement. Indeed,
there is a terrific opportunity to work tri-laterally with Peru, Ecuador and Colombia not only on counter drug matters-

SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea has indicated its interest in holding direct talks with the United States, a news report
said, after the two sides traded barbs over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programs at a security forum. &quot;We are not
against a dialogue. We are not against any negotiation for the issues of common concern,&quot; Japan's Kyodo news agency
quoted North Korean ambassador to the United Nations Sin Son Ho as saying Friday. But the ambassador, speaking in
New York, dismissed the possibility of a return to stalled nuclear negotiations involving the two Koreas, the U.S., Japan,
China and Russia, saying &quot;the six-party talks are gone forever.&quot; The U.S. has offered to hold talks with the North within
the six-nation process if it returns to the negotiating table and takes irreversible steps for denuclearization. Last
weekend, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Kurt Campbell indicated that the chances for direct talks between North
Korea and the U.S. were slim. &quot;Our bilateral negotiations are between the U.S. and South Korea about our collective
approach&quot; to the North, Campbell told reporters in Seoul. Sin said the five other parties to the nuclear talks &quot;cheated&quot;
North Korea, accusing them of not implementing what they had agreed under a disarmament-for-aid deal. No more
details were given in the Kyodo report. Sin was not available for comment Saturday. The North Korean mission to the
U.N. declined to comment. North Korea quit the nuclear talks in April to protest a U.N. statement condemning a rocket
launch. North Korea insisted it sent a satellite into orbit, while the U.S. and its allies said it was actually a long-range
missile test. North Korea conducted its second nuclear test in May and a barrage of missile tests in July, drawing
international condemnation and new U.N. sanctions. U.S. and Chinese officials are expected to discuss North Korea's
nuclear programs and other regional security issues at a strategic dialogue next week in Washington. &quot;North Korea will
be a significant topic, but obviously one among many,&quot; State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said Friday in

with all parties as a result of the Commons expenses scandal; 27 percent voting for fringe parties.)
Gordon will attempt to overwhelm news coverage of the loss with a cabinet reshuffle, as early as the
next day, June 5. The plot (sounds like the Tudors): David is the target, from multiple angles and
motives, personal ambition mixed with anti-Blairism. Peter has always wanted to be Foreign
Secretary, a job held by his grandfather, Herbert Morrison. (Morrison was also deputy PM, why
doesn't Peter want that?) New Labour people regard Peter as more ambitious than New Labour at
this point. He supported Gordon's utterly misbegotten and wildly unpopular proposal to raise the top
tax rate to 50 percent. The fallout is less resentment of the affluent to paying more or grudging
understanding of need for new revenues as it is a sense that Labour under Gordon is abandoning the
project for social aspiration and opportunity that is at the heart of the New Labour message. Ed Balls,
one of Gordon's closest longtime advisers, is also determined to topple David. Balls is a
contemporary of David's, wants to be leader of the party himself, and continues the Gordon v. Tony
bitter rivalry into the future. Balls is currently Minister for Children and Schools and was linked to
Damian McBride (Gordon's hatchetman, who has trashed Blairites, got caught out on his blogging
scheme to smear Cameron). If Gordon names Peter to David's job, Balls would take Peter's and
become Business Secretary. David would be pushed into Home Secretary. Once Balls takes Peter's
job, Balls will likely reverse Peter's privatization proposal for the Royal Mail to win support from party's
left-wing base, beginning of his campaign against David for post-Gordon leadership struggle. Tony

SUbject: Human Rights report on Haiti
Cheryl,
Local media drew attention this weekend to the line in the introduction of our annual human rights report that
refers to the GOH by saying that there is severe corruption in all branches of government, called this morning
asking for a copy of the report (which we sent him), saying that the President was upset and wanted to read it. The
Embassy human rights officer sent the Department a first draft of this report late last year. It normally would have gone
through two or three more versions with input from DRL and ultimately clearance by the Embassy Front Office. Because
our Human Rights officer (Kathey-Lee Galvin) was seriously injured in the quake, DRL took it upon themselves to finish
the report. The final draft was never sent to us for clearance/comments and I don't know who all in the Department
cleared off on it. You may already be familiar with the report, but in the event you are not, I wanted you to have a copy

The Watch received the following readout of CODEL McCain's April 23 meetings in Cairo.
Foreign Minister Alaraby:
McCain discussed his visit to Libya, emphasizing it appeared a stalemate was emerging. McCain supported the
decision to send in predator drones and would like NATO to provide equipment, as well as training, to the rebel
forces. McCain characterized the TNC as &quot;good people,&quot; but said its military was far less impressive.
Regarding the possibility of Egypt increasing aid to the TNC, Alaraby said Egypt was reluctant to provide additional
support out of concern for the estimated 1 million Egyptian nationals living in Libya.
Alaraby reiterated Egypt is in no rush to restore diplomatic relations with Iran.
Alaraby said Egypt will abide by all agreements made with Israel. He encouraged the United States to support, or
at least not oppose, recognition of Palestinian statehood in the UN.
McCain said the USG had discussed a modest assistance package for Egypt, but warned it was probably more
modest than Egypt wished given the current economic climate. McCain planned to organize a group of businessmen to
visit Egypt and encouraged Alaraby to create a more pro-business environment.
Defense Minister, Field Marshall Tantawi:
The meeting focused on Libya and strategies to increase U.S. and Egyptian assistance. The discussion was not as in
depth as McCain's meeting with the FM. Tantawi echoed Alaraby's concern about Egyptian nationals in Libya and
request for increased U.S. assistance.

Re: Water
To update you, at G we have been working on water and World Water Day (the event planned takes place at the
National Geographic Building), since I am taking on water as the key issue I am/will working on. I sent S a memo on
water in December outlining our plans. Note that we are mandated to report to Congress annually as part of the &quot;Water
for the Poor&quot; Act.
I have met with Kerri-Ann, with OES &quot;water&quot; staff in the last weeks to address this and also with several regional bureau
A/S (Carson, Feltman, Blake so far) on water in the respective regions.
There is a great deal of interest on their part and we have started outlining specific initiatives that we could focus on.
We've also met on the Nile Basin Initiative, with World Bank &quot;experts&quot; leading NGOs, McKinsey, etc. I've also spoken to
Raj (USAID allocated about $480 million in FY 2009 to water, and MCC about $500 million) but of course he has been
unable to focus on this. And Cheryl and I haven't spoken yet about Food Security/water.
Best,

Spanish FM Moratinos has requested to speak with you today. Tom can give u verbal download but below are basic
points. Let me know if u want us to set up call
Points:
- We condemn the effort to remove Zelaya from office.
- We are working within the OAS and with our regional partners to resolve this situation quickly and in a manner that
restores democratic order.
- We appreciate the role Spain played in winning quick EU condemnation of the coup attempt.
- Our work is not done. Rebuilding trust among competing political institutions and reducing polarization within
Honduras will take a lot of work. We hope Spain will work with us and the OAS to ensure a restoration of democratic

&quot;If President Obama is looking for a way to excite us with an American vision for a Palestinian state--one that
can be started on even before core issues are (entirely) resolved, and which implies what is plausible about
peaceful integration with Israel and Jordan--he could do worse than publicly get behind the RAND

As Haiti enters the period of electoral contestation, it is essential that all political actors remain
calm and encourage their supporters to do the same. The United States, together with Haiti's
international community partners, stands ready to support efforts to thoroughly review irregularities
in support of electoral results that are consistent with the will of the Haitian people expressed in
their votes.
Like others, the Government of the United States is concerned by the Provisional Electoral
Council's announcement of results from the November 28 national elections that are inconsistent
with the published results of the National Election Observation Council (CNO), which had more
than 5,500 observers and observed the vote count in 1,600 voting centers nationwide, election-day
observations by official U.S. observers accredited by the CEP, and vote counts observed around the
country by numerous domestic and international observers.

Clinton briefs top US official on North Korea trip WASHINGTON, August 6, 2009 (AFP) - Ex-president Bill Clinton has
given a top US official an initial readout on his North Korea trip and plans to conduct a more formal and in-depth
debriefing for the White House, officials said Thursday.Clinton spoke to a member of President Barack Obama's national
security council on Wednesday night, hours after flying home from negotiating the release of two jailed US journalists,
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said.&quot;We are going to get a fuller briefing,&quot; Gibbs said, adding that Obama was
also seeking to sit down with the former president to get a rare view from at the inner workings of Kim Jong-II's hermetic
political system.The White House has so far declined to detail the nature of Clinton's conversations, other than to style
the visit as a purely humanitarian mission that included no message from Obama to the leadership in Pyongyang.The
Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Clinton discussed a broad range of issues in a three-hour encounter with Kim,
and told him Pyongyang could benefit if it released kidnapped South Korean and Japanese nationals.The paper quoted a
South Korean official as saying Kim was hoping to secure the kind of direct summit with Obama that he failed to lock in
with the former president as his administration drew to a close in 2000 and 2001.A day after Obama told North Korea it

    <body>Madam Secretary,
Following up on your trip to Ecuador, Jake asked me to send you a quick update on the Financial Action Task Force's
(FATF) listing of Ecuador:
(SBU) On June 25 the FATF moved Ecuador down a notch from a list of countries with serious strategic deficiencies in
measures against money laundering and financing terrorism. Ecuador is now on the &quot;Improving AML/CFT Compliance:
On-going Process&quot; list for showing progress in its efforts against money laundering and financing terrorism.
(SBU) According to Treasury, the change in Ecuador's status stems from its commitment to an action plan with the FATF,
and the GOE's demonstrated high-level political commitment to work toward AML/CFT (anti-money laundering —
combating the financing of terrorism) compliance.
WHA is looking into options for next steps.
Please let me know if you would like any further information.

On eve of Mother's Day, Clinton pushes for paid leave for new parents From CNN Senior State Department Producer

federal employees who are parents of newborn or newly adopted children on Friday, in a videotaped Mother's. Day

family,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;Whether you're welcoming a new baby, juggling soccer practice and piano lessons, or even
helping plan your daughter's wedding --parenting can be more than a full-time job.&quot;Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, is
getting married this summer. Currently, federal employees do not get paid maternity or paternity leave. Clinton said she
would work with Congress to take &quot;overdue&quot; steps to provide State Department families with the paid time off they
need to recuperate from childbirth, care for the mother, care for a newborn With a serious ailment or disability, or

    <body>I went back upstairs with Dr Kissinger and we talked about it. I regret the seating, it just begged Meacham to interview
you, to ask a question, then alternate answering. Was just a very different dynamic than you two before the sitdown. It
would be bad TV. But it's print.
So as an observer, and I think this will come across to the reader, it was a fascinating meeting of two eras that are very
different but very the same. Two very different people, but the same job, experiencing it much the same way. His spiel
at the end about the goal should be more than ending the war will translate well.
And most importantly, the photos look great
He was also a sport and called my friend and talked for 10 mins about non-proliferation

    <body>I met with Holbrooke today on water. Pakistani military called it their third most important strategic issue. Great
worries about India/Pakistan tension over 1960 agreement that regulates Indus River. We agreed our teams will work
together, most likely through the World Bank supporting the Abu Dhabi Dialogue, which brings together representatives
from the seven countries that share the Indus River Basin. This is the best forum we know of where India and Pakistan
can meet to discuss water issues. In the context of the shared waters memo and chart I gave you last week, this ranks as
potentially one of the most conflict prone, and one where the US should engage to get the parties to work together.
We are advancing well in developing a policy/action plan for you to announce on World Water Day on March 22.
Safe travels to Latin America, so glad you are going.

ExxonMobil's senior management had just informed Kosmos/Blackstone that they were exercising a clause in the
Kosmos-ExxonMobil sales agreement to cancel the deal. Kosmos was stunned by the decision, but thinks ExxonMobil's

In Kosovo crazy for the Clintons
By Mary Beth Sheridan
Washington Post Staff Writer
Wednesday, October 13, 2010; 9:41 AM
PRISTINA, KOSOVO- This poor, tiny corner of Europe turned into the Land of Clinton on Wednesday, with thousands of
Kosovo residents turning out to greet Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and pay homage to her husband.
Former president Bill Clinton is revered here for his role in ending the Yugoslav &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; campaign of the late
1990s.
Arriving in Pristina, Clinton's motorcade slowed to a halt on the central Bill Clinton Boulevard, and she hopped out of her
car to personally inspect an 11-foot gold statue of the former president. She waved and smiled as a crowd brandished
American flags, applauded and chanted &quot;Hill-a-REE!! Hill-a-REE!&quot;
Above the little plaza, an image of Clinton grinned from a giant billboard. Hillary Clinton's face beamed from another
billboard nearby, bearing the word &quot;Welcome.&quot;
After posing for photos with the Bill Clinton statue, the secretary of state ducked into the Hillary boutique next door.
As she emerged, a local reporter approached. &quot;Do you like it?&quot; the reporter asked, gesturing to the statue. &quot;Your
husband.&quot;

I've been hearing really incredible feedback on the secretary's speech. One thing that people keep saying is that this is
the first time they can recall a secretary getting &quot;technical&quot; on the issue. Often times leaders just tell feel good
stories. I think we really took a big step forward by laying out our vision for food security through the seven areas of
focus and how we'll work through country-led processes like CAADP. People also really like how Megan made that great
connection between Ejeta's life work and our plan going forward. Megan did a great job laying out the lab to farm to
market to table. That's exactly what we're going for and what hasn't been articulated well in the past. Let's keep the
dialogue at a high level and really challenge people on this issue in the future – not just regurgitate USAID success stories
like we did during the Bush years!

Per the VoA pronunciation guide: ab-YAY (Ops). The FY09 base level for Sudan assistance programs is $327m vs $403m

and we recently notified the Court that we needed additional time to review the policy. That review is underway; no

Trying to figure out what's actually happening here.

Subject: (Reuters) Netanyahu presents U.S. settlement plan to cabinet
JERUSALEM (Reuters) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented a U.S. plan to his cabinet November 14
that would extend a freeze on West Bank settlements for 90 days in return for diplomatic and security incentives.
Washington wants Israel to renew a freeze on settlement building in efforts to resume peace talks with Palestinians,
who in September halted negotiations after just a few weeks when Israel refused to extend a 10-month settlement
freeze.
Under the U.S. proposal, if Israel extended the freeze Washington would pledge not to seek further extensions and to
veto any attempts at the United Nations to force a unilateral peace settlement.
U.S. security aid to Israel would also be upgraded.
&quot;I will insist that in any proposal Israel's security needs will be addressed, both in the immediate term and regarding
the threats facing us in the coming decade,&quot; Netanyahu said in public comments before the cabinet meeting.
The prime minister has previously said any settlement moratorium will not apply to areas around East Jerusalem that
Israel captured during a 1967 war and the Palestinians want as the capital of a future state.
One official in Netanyahu's office said the proposal had &quot;positive elements&quot;. Israeli political sources said a narrow
majority in Netanyahu's security cabinet, which is ultimately responsible, would likely support accepting the U.S.
proposal.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton shared the plan at a meeting in New York last week, Netanyahu said, adding that
U.S. and Israeli teams were still negotiating a final formula.
A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahrnoud Abbas said there had been no official word regarding a renewed
Israeli freeze on housing starts in the occupied West Bank.
&quot;An official Palestinian commitment will come only after President Abbas hears officially from the American
administration what is going on between them and the Israelis,&quot; Nabil Abu Rdainah told Reuters.
Palestinian officials in private have expressed anger over U.S. incentives to get Israel to prolong the partial freeze,
saying they were effectively bribing Israel to fulfill basic international obligations.
Israeli officials said Netanyahu, who faces a tough political sell within his own coalition on the settlement issue, had
pushed Clinton for the broad understandings.
Settler leaders, who said acceptance of the proposal would represent &quot;a fundamental collapse&quot; of the government's
integrity, called an emergency meeting to discuss the issue.
Under the U.S. plan, Israel would declare a further, three month suspension of construction in the West Bank, land it
captured in a 1967 war where Palestinians seek a state. Any building launched since the original moratorium ended late
in September would be frozen, a diplomatic source said.
Among the pledges offered to Israel by Washington was a guarantee to veto any resolutions brought to the United
Nations Security Council that seek &quot;to impose a political settlement on Israel,&quot; the source said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
The United States would also undertake to veto resolutions deemed anti-Israel in the United Nations and other
international organisations, a move that could make Israel less vulnerable to threats made by some Palestinians to
declare statehood unilaterally in the event that peace talks fail.

H: FYI. The end of Justice Jim. Sid
Supreme Court Justice Jim Johnson, known both for his segregationist political activities in the 1950s and dabbling in
the political campaign against Bill Clinton during his presidency, died yesterday.
A Faulkner County sheriffs office spokesman, Lt. Matt Rice, said Johnson was found dead in his home about 10 a.m.
Saturday with an apparently self-inflicted chest wound from a .30-30 rifle. Johnson had been beset by medical
problems, he said. Roller-McNutt Funeral Home in Conway will be handling arrangements.

Nelson to back 'Don't ask' repeal
By: Jen DiMascio
May 26, 2010 12:08 PM EDT
Nebraska Sen. Ben Nelson (D) will back repeal of don't ask don't tell, likely putting repeal proponents over the top in
their quest to end the ban on gays serving openly in the military.
&quot;I don't believe that most Nebraskans want to continue a policy that not only encourages but requires people to be
deceptive and to lie. The 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy does just that,&quot; Nelson said. &quot;It also encourages suspicion and
senior officers to look the other way. In a military which values honesty and integrity, this policy encourages deceit.&quot;
&quot;I will support the Lieberman compromise because it removes politics from the process. It bases implementation of the
repeal on the Pentagon's review and a determination by our military leaders that repeal is consistent with military
readiness and effectiveness, and that the Pentagon has prepared the necessary regulations to make the changes,&quot; he
said, adding that he spoke with Defense Secretary Robert Gates about the issue.
&quot;He advised that while he preferred waiting until the study is completed, he can live with this compromise,&quot; Nelson said.
Given statements made by Sens. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.), Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) that they, too, will
vote for repeal, Nebraska's Nelson would be the critical 15th vote required for repeal to be included in the defense
authorization bill.

Depending of course on how the meeting goes today, we think it would be very good if the Secretary could attend the
VP meeting tomorrow to make sure that the hard questions about where we are on Iraq government formation are
addressed.
The Secretary uniquely brings the ability to express her instincts on where this process is going (or not going) and she
brings the understanding of the whole region that we must take into account as we push for an Iraqi government. Her
understanding of where we are on the Peace Process, our credibility with the full range of Arab leaders, and our
relationship with Iran, are subjects she can put on the table and make sure are comprehensively considered before any
decisions on a way forward are reached.

Kris,
Background All this separate from Simon's broader system(s) potential. Jim (James F.)Blom is Dave's former business
partner in Alacrity Homeland Group. Lives in San Francisco w/ wife and 2 kids. American, but well healed due to long
family history in Norwegian shipping companies. Grandfather was pals with Onassis. You get the picture. Has tight
linkage in supply chain &amp; IT space(s). Deals in countries like you and I dealt with counties / states. Brilliant, resourceful.
Not prone to hyperbole, says he can bring the 'best in the world' to this effort Based on track record , I believe him. For
example, CdeBaca recently met with social networking folks in Silicon Valley. Not sure how that went, but Jim is close
friends with the guy who handles 'Facebook's' finances and said he can get his attention 'in one phone call'. Social
networking piece helpful, but probably a more aggressive 'identify, track, snag, deal with' traffickers required. Method(s)
&amp; prioritization necessary. Let's look into. Spoke w/ Jim about CdeBaca connect. We're in. Best, Marty

Hillary and Cheryl,
I'm feeling very good about our recent efforts to connect our speeches thematically. We've done it with development,
human rights, and Internet freedom; and most recently with AIPAC, Ctr for Middle East Peace, and next the AJC. Here's
what I want to suggest: The three most basic elements of human existence are food, water, and health. We have now
done major speeches on food and water. I'd like us to consider a major speech on global health — the third in a
trilogy. Linking these three issues thematically, we can explain how and why foreign policy challenges and solutions

Subject: Thank you Secretary Clinton
Huma and Cheryl...hope this finds you well...please thank Secretary Clinton for her faith in us.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, Senator Casey, I can't thank you enough for asking that question, because I
think you are 100 percent right. I obviously believe that what we're doing is part of our security. And I think
that case is certainly more understandable for people today, since 9/11, than it might have been beforehand. But
I also think it is essential to our economy.
You illustrate one example of that, the Export-Import Bank. We really believe that we can do even more
through the EXIM Bank, and I'm going to try to encourage that approach. Somebody asked me what I'd like to
do; I said I'd like to put EXIM Bank on steroids because I think it does so much good work for American
companies, and I want American businesses to know that.

to be on the ground dealing with the operation and also translating for the public what is going on. I know you don't

    <subject>Fw: (Reuters) U.S. Senate panel approves new arms treaty with Russia</subject>
    <body>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate panel approved a new strategic nuclear arms control treaty with Russia on
September 16, advancing one of President Barack Obama's main foreign policy priorities to an uncertain future in the
full Senate. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 14-4 to approve the new START treaty. The full Senate must
consent to the agreement before it can go into effect, but with Congress in the hottest part of the political season
before mid-term congressional elections, it is unclear when the treaty will get a vote on the Senate floor. The
agreement signed by Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in April commits former Cold War foes
Washington and Moscow to reducing deployed nuclear warheads by about 30 percent.
It picked up some Republican support in the foreign relations committee from Senators Bob Corker and Johnny lsakson.
They voted aye along with Richard Lugar, previously the only Senate Republican who had publicly supported the
treaty. But since 67 votes are needed to meet the two-thirds minimum required for treaties to pass the full Senate, at
least eight Republicans will have to vote for it. Most Republicans have remained uncommitted for months, leaving the
treaty's fate in limbo. The weak Republican support to date and the fact the Senate has a lot of business to take care of
before the congressional November 2 elections, makes the new START treaty a likely candidate for the &quot;lame duck&quot;

Here's the reporters description on the piece: &quot;...a large profile of Bob Barnett for the Style section. I know Barnett has
been a friend and counselor and campaign supporter over the years. I would like to ask Secretary Clinton her estimation

the years. And I would like to ask what she makes of how such a committed Democrat as Barnett is able to work so well

    <body>Here's some background: This piece is for a year-ending look-ahead issue of The Economist and we were asked to write
about America's priorities and place in the world in 2011, ten years after 9/11 and twenty years after the end of the Cold
War. The team (Jake, Josh, Anne-Marie, Derek) felt that this was a good opportunity to pull together for a wide audience
some of the key themes you sounded in Krakow and elsewhere, and build on the President's call to action at UNGA. We
don't say anything new here, its true, but the idea was to lay down another marker that these are issues that are
important to you and to the administration.

Subject: Strategic Communications for Pakistan
Hello Madame Secretary. I hope you have a productive trip to Pakistan. I wanted to let you know that Ambassador
Haqqani asked me to submit a proposal to help the Government of Pakistan strengthen its communications with the
Pakistani public.
You may recall that my firm did similar hands-on work in Lebanon. The idea is to enhance the Government's internal
capacity to raise public awareness of its accomplishments, build support for its policies, and demonstrate the benefits of
democratic governance.
With stronger communications, they'd obviously be in a better position to convey the benefits of the US-Pakistan
relationship. We've followed Pakistani media coverage of Kerry-Lugar -- with more strategic communications
management by the Government, that could have been a positive story.
(The anti-American forces have used the same messages to attack US aid packages for at least 10 years. It was easy to
see the attacks coming.)
Communications help won't solve the immediate political crisis, but it could be one useful element of a larger strategic
communications strategy.

Joint Statement by Former President Clinton and Secretary of State Clinton on the Passing of Dr. Dorothy Height We are
deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Dr. Dorothy. Height, an icon of America's long march toward equality and a
personal inspiration to us both. As the only woman among the &quot;Big Six&quot; civil rights leaders, Dr. Height helped galvanize a
movement that changed our country forever. She organized the &quot;Wednesdays in Mississippi&quot; meetings that brought
black and white women together to find common ground and break down barriers. She never stopped fighting for what
she knew was right. And through it all, she was always the best dressed woman in the room. We were blessed to know
Dr. Height, to benefit from her grace, passion and wisdom, and to call her our friend. For decades, starting with the early
days at the Children's Defense Fund, we worked with her, learned from her, and drew inspiration from her example.
From the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to the Congressional Gold Medal, to the unveiling of a long-sought-after bust
of Sojourner Truth in the United States Capitol, we had the privilege of helping honor Dr. Height and her
accomplishments. Born before women had the right to vote, denied access to the college of her choice because of the

Subject: Shannon &amp; Valenzuela -- DeMint Staff Mtg
Cheryl,
Rich and I met this morning with Chris Socha, Senator DeMint's foreign policy staffer. We took the
opportunity to discuss the nominations of Tom Shannon and Arturo Valenzuela. As you know, DeMint has
been very outspoken regarding Zelaya's ouster in Honduras.
With respect to Tom, it appears as though little has changed - DeMint still appears to be insisting on some
amount of floor debate followed by a roll call vote on the nomination. How much time and when is still
something that needs to be worked out. We've been following up on our end, but the DeMint camp has
slow walked things a bit. We expect to come to some agreement when the Senate reconvenes.
Arturo's nomination is in a different posture. As we approached the Senate's August recess, there
appeared to be some loosening of DeMint's hold on him. After speaking with DeMint's staff, we're still
hopeful that we could get Arturo confirmed by either voice vote or by unanimous consent when the Senate
returns. However, Chris warned that DeMint is monitoring closely the Administration's position
with regards to sanctions. He warned that if a coup determination is made and new sanctions
levied, this could very well have an adverse impact on how Arturo's nomination moves forward.
We wanted to alert you to this latter point because we understand a determination from L
could be coming down shortly.
DeMint's staffer explained that the Senator would welcome a call from either S or Deputy Steinberg, and
he thought a call could go a long way to freeing up Arturo's nomination. We're preparing a call sheet for
Deputy Steinberg.
Thanks.
Miguel E. Rodriguez

    <subject>Fw: (Reuters) Kyrgyzstan asks Russia to help quell ethnic clashes</subject>
    <body>OSH - Kyrgyzstan appealed for Russian help to stop ethnic fighting that has killed at least 62 and left parts of its second-
largest city in flames, the worst violence since the president was toppled in April. The interim government in
Kyrgyzstan, which hosts U.S. and Russian military bases, said it was powerless to stop armed gangs from burning down
the homes and businesses of ethnic Uzbeks in parts of Osh. Gun battles raged throughout the night.
&quot;We need the entry of outside armed forces to calm the situation down,&quot; interim government leader Roza Otunbayeva
told reporters. &quot;We have appealed to Russia for help and I have already signed such a letter for President Dmitry
Medvedev.&quot;
Russian PM Putin and Otunbayeva discussed the situation in a telephone call on June 12, the Russian government's press
service said, without giving details.
A Reuters correspondent in Osh said gun battles had taken place through the night in an Uzbek neighbourhood. Gas was
shut off to Osh and some neighborhoods have no electricity. &quot;Entire streets are on fire,&quot; Interior Ministry spokesman
Rakhmatillo Akhmedov said. &quot;The situation is very bad. There is no sign of it stopping. Homes have been set ablaze.&quot;
Otunbayeva said Osh was also facing a humanitarian crisis as food was running out. She said her government had
decided to open the border to Uzbekistan to allow fleeing Uzbeks to escape, although it was not clear who controlled
the frontier. One witness said some women and children had made it across to the Uzbek town of Marhamat, 638 miles

    <body>The UK election, I think, reflects lingering fixation on Tony. They just can't get over him. The British public feels like the
wife he abandoned for George W. Bush, wants vengeance, yet still pines for him. Clegg is a Tony stand-in love object,
Cameron a pretender. Alas, poor Gordon, Heathcliffe, unloved, unlovable, suffering.

but we will agree to udpate);
2 - and he still has concerns about verification. For the last 30 days, we have tried to connect him with rose g and ted
warner from DoD. Looks like that will finally happen next week. They can and will alleviate his concerns (we hope).
That's what I know. I am sure he will be pleased to hear that we had a constructive meeting with Senator Kyl and are

    <body>I'm heading back from meetings on women, peace and security at NATO. The chief implementer of WPS at DOD also
traveled with me. It was extremely productive. SG Rasmussen chaired a meeting on 1325 today of all the NATO member
and partner ambassadors incl DaIcier. The new NATO special rep for 1325 -- the position sponsored by Norway and
approved at the Chicago summit — gave her inaugural address, and my DOD colleague and I discussed the US efforts
both generally and in Afghanistan. We were followed by extensive remarks from the NATO ambassadors, all of whom
touched on the importance of women's role in security and NATO's mission, as well as applauded US leadership. Many
mentioned you in their interventions! The ambs from Serbia, Azerbaijan and Georgia pointed to their own national
action plans (their existence was a surprise to us), as well as the new structures they have put in place to implement
them. The ambassador from Azerbaijan even said that he is hopeful women will contribute to ending their regional
conflict (I will tell Morningstar). The new special rep - a seasoned diplomat who knows her way around NATO --- wanted
me to ten you how much you have inspired her -- something I hear everywhere!
I'm confident our NATO visit also served to reinforce the importance of the NAP and the US role with our own people
both at NATO and DOD.
I was sorry to miss the discussion with ASSK but there are more events with her tomw. We are working hard on getting
the engagement of Burmese women into the formal peace structures being put in place to end the ethnic conflicts.
I also met with Vivian Redding at the EU who, despite her efforts, is unlikely to get a quota for women on public boards
of directors adopted. She too expressed her admiration of you and your leadership.
In addition to everything that's been said about Chris Stevens, he really understood the important role the women in
Libya were playing in peace and security. Whenever I met with Libyan women at meetings in the region, they went out
of their way to tell me how much he supported them and how much affection they had for him. Such an awful loss.
You've been magnificent throughout all this, despite how wrenching it's been.

really helped in interacting with HHS and addressing the technical issues. She has also participated in meetings with Jack

I wanted to let you know that after a great deal of soul-searching, I have decided to leave the State Department in about
a month.
This was an exceptionally difficult decision; one of the most difficult I have made in my life. It has been a honor and a
real joy to have been part of the team here at State; the past year has been one of the most enriching experiences of my
career. I am leaving only for personal reasons; after pushing myself as hard as I possibly could the last several years, I
need to do this for myself, to spend some time away from work with my family and friends and reenergize.
Thank you once again for the remarkable opportunity to serve our country and work for the Secretary. This has been a

The hardliners in the regime fought a largely successful counterattack against the deal today, and M appears to be
leaning toward their view that if he steps aside he will endanger the elections.
It goes beyond that. For the hardliners this is almost a religious struggle against a Zelaya they view as dangerous,
duplicitous and vengeful. As one of the hardliners told me two weeks ago: &quot;We are prepared to die for this.&quot;
The modest silver lining is that the military has weighed in on the side of the moderates -- the latter include all three of
the de facto negotiators who reached the October 30 Accord.
Hugo believes strongly that Ishould fly down Tuesday morning for one last, blunt effort. Arturo, Dan Restrepo and I
agree. Last time my message, while firm, appealed to M's better angels -- the chance to leave office as a statesman and
deal a strategic defeat to Chavez. I will sharpen it tomorrow. The hardliners fail to see how they are playing into the
hands of the worst actors in the hemisphere -- ALBA crowing will be part of the de facto legacy. I will also make clear

Subject: Senator Webb Press Comments read-out
Colleagues,
FYI, following is a read-out of Senator Webb's comments to the press August 16 in Bangkok.
• Senator Webb first delivered a prepared statement, in which he said his visit to Burma had three purposes:
1)to appeal for Yettaw's deportation;
2)to visit ASSK;
3)to ask to the Burmese leadership to end her house arrest.
• The Senator summarized the basis of his humanitarian appeal, noting Yettaw's health and stating that the
[trespassing] incident was regrettable but not mean-spirited.
• With ASSK, he said he had discussed elections and sanctions issues, but declined to characterize the content of
their conversation.
• With the leadership, he said he had raised a wide range of issues, including elections. He conveyed to the
generals that it would be hard for the world to view the Burmese elections as free and fair without the
participation of ASSK and her supporters. Asked whether free and fair elections are possible given the Burmese
constitution's structure, Webb said the constitution does not necessarily constrain elections.
• Senator Webb explained he was not a U.S. Government envoy. Asked whether his visit would trigger a review
of U.S. Burma policy, the Senator responded that Secretary Clinton had already called for a review and that he
would discuss his visit with the Secretary.
• Asked why he was received by the Burmese leadership while the UN Secretary General was not, the Senator
referred to his 18-year record of working on Southeast Asia issues and his record in Vietnam. He did not
characterize his own position on sanctions. With respect to human rights groups' fear that his visit would lend
legitimacy the regime, Webb firmly restated his qualifications and record.
• The Senator indicated that he viewed this as a possible opening for progress, but did not make any indications or
suggestions on next steps.

    <body>Subject startegic communications
Greetings from Nairobi. I'm at the end of week-long trip to Kampala, Kinshasa and now Nairobi. The trip has been very
productive and I will fill you in on some of the discussions I have been having when I return. In the meantime, I know
that there are a number of discussions with Dan Benjamin and others relating to a new more aggressive approach to
CVE and I wanted to update you on my thoughts in terms of how those critical discussions fit in with our overall
approach to strategic communications around the globe.
As you and I have discussed, it is essential that we become much more pro-active in all our communications efforts. To
put it bluntly, we are in an &quot;information war&quot; on all fronts. With the proliferation of media outlets and opportunities
around the world, we must fight aggressively to get, and maintain, our fair share of &quot;consumer share of mind.&quot; Both our
adversaries and allies recognize the importance of this aspect of foreign policy and are adopting new ways of
communicating with foreign publics. Consumers everywhere are constantly facing a barrage of information and in some
cases misinformation and dis-information. In order to get our messages across and confront the threats posed by our
adversaries, we must develop a new sense of urgency in all our communications efforts. Much has been said and written
about the concept of &quot;soldier diplomats&quot;. In the same vein, I believe we must empower a corps of &quot;diplomat soldiers&quot; to
help us gain ground in this new war.
While countering violent extremism is, and will remain, a key objective of our communications efforts we must apply the
same level of determination with respect to all communications. We must both aggressively promote positive stories
about the US and rapidly respond to attacks against us. In the past, our failure to respond to attacks and distortions has
diminished our credibility and undermined our ability to combat our adversaries. For example, had we not responded to
all the rumors and innuendos surrounding our relief efforts in Haiti, I believe we would have provided a fertile field for
AQ and others to continue to perpetuate the image of the US as an &quot;invader&quot;.
Before I left for this trip, I convened a meeting of our top PD officers and told them that we must become much more
aggressive in our strategic communications programs and initiatives. We plan to implement daily calls between our new
regional PD DAS's and PAO's in the regions so we can monitor on a daily basis all stories about the USG. We will work
with the Posts to ensure that they have strategies for dealing with stories as they develop. I would also like to request
that you send a cable to all Chiefs of Mission informing of the new strategy and reminding them of their responsibilities
in this critical area. We will work on a draft for your review when you return.
Finally, we are developing new organizational solutions, modeled on an approach I saw at our Mission in Uganda, which
I think will greatly clarify roles and responsibilities with respect to in country communications not only within the

Subject: (The Detroit News) Burned Quran smeared with feces found at East Lansing mosque
(The Detroit News) - A burned Quran was found at a mosque in East Lansing September 11, prompting the Michigan
chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-MI) to ask the FBI to investigate.
CAIR-MI reports that officials of the Islamic Center of East Lansing say vandals left a burned Quran at the front entrance
of the mosque and scatted pages in the street nearby.
&quot;The perpetrators of this unconscionable act of religious intimidation must be apprehended and prosecuted to the full
extent of state and federal law,&quot; CAIR-MI Executive Director Dawud Walid, said in a statement.

Just saw a portion of S interview with Jorge Ramos. She hit the ball out of the park on the question framed around
Enrique Krauze's NYT op-ed today about US moral hypocrisy. I don't think he was expecting her to give a categorical
answer and address the issue head on. They teased her response to a question about Chavez's comment that Obama is
ignorant. They will air it in Ramos' Sunday talk show. My mom saw the Telemundo interview with Sevcec. She said that

points. Let me know if u want us to set up call
Points:
- We condemn the effort to remove Zelaya from office.
- We are working within the OAS and with our regional partners to resolve this situation quickly and in a manner that
restores democratic order.
°- We appreciate the role Spain played in winning quick EU condemnation of the coup attempt.
- Our work is not done. Rebuilding trust among competing political institutions and reducing polarization within
Honduras will take a lot of work. We hope Spain will work with us and the OAS to ensure a restoration of democratic
order that will allow Honduras to carry through with it electoral timetable (presidential vote scheduled for November)

Subj: list of 5 update
Hello Melanne,
Well the list of 5 continues to be a Quizomba dance (a bit forward, a bit backward).
On the positive.
The two, Mosala and Pitchen, that had been commanders in Kimia II, have finally been changed. They are
supposedly in route to Kinshasa.
That means none of the 5 are now in active operational command position.
This is positive.
All 5 are supposedly in Kinshasa, but not yet confirmed. 2 are in the central prison in Kinshasa.
On the negative.
None of the 5 have been charged. 2 are arbitrarily detained.
More negative.
We received attached request this week for support to investigate the cases of the 5 officers. While only about
$70,000, the request is strange and worrying. In 4 of the cases an open file in North or South Kivu military
prosecutors office exists. Only in the case of should the Military Prosecutor General need to be
involved, given the rank of the suspect.
In all 5 cases the local military prosecutor had opened a legal investigation and had interviewed all the
victims. The cases were stopped by political or financial intervention. Now the request indicates the Military
Prosecutor General needs to fly all over the country to investigate. Not only is the request 18 months late in
coming, it makes no sense. In 4 of 5 cases, the military prosecutor in the Province has jurisdiction. They just
need to continue their work. With the suspects all in Kinshasa, it makes their work more difficult.
Is someone trying to make some money? Were they given the impression that the international community is so
interested in this case, but the government is not? Or is there so little trust in the local prosecutors that central
government wants more control? Or do governmental officials know so little about how criminal cases function
that they are inadvertently delaying procedures.
Conclusion. Lobby has been effective to remove from position of active command. Political intervention has not

I have to admit I don't understand statistics enough to gauge it's accuracy, but they are trying to prove the accusation of
egregious fraud. The only other #s are actual vote tallies coming from the Iranian Interior Ministry, showing Mousavi
winning by far - but the #s are unconfirmed.

OK. Went through it. It's not too much shorter, but I think it's tighter here and there. Made slight change at
end to try to tie in with how it started to bring full circle.
An area where you could save time and space (but I didn't try to change it) would be to shorten the parts where
you talk about Israel and Palestine and about Iraq and Afghanistan - it seems to me that those are tactical
discussions of an existing issue, and somewhat removed from the more abstract and strategic policy outline
she's otherwise aiming at here.
By the way, the phrase &quot;global network of diverse partnerships&quot; seems to be absent now. I kind of liked it on
several levels, but I presume it met some objection along the way...

Hilary,
You may know but for the last four years I have been working with the Qatari's and in particular with Sheikha Moser on
disability issues in Qatar and I have built up a good relationship with them
Sheikha Moser has approached me privately saying they are keen to get their relationship with the USA onto a more
positive footing and she was hoping for a &quot;women-to women&quot; one to one private meeting with you. She is happy to
come to Washington if you could make some time available.

Huma,
There has been strong movement to Bukova today.
Baki is expected to pull out before 4th round at noon our time. The 4th round would end up as final round with Hosni-
Bukova (Bulgaria) contest.
French Unesco ambassador told our Unesco Anb Killion that France has informed Egypt that they will not support
Hosni.
France (Quai and Elysee agree) is now openly working for Bukova. Kouchner may try to call S.
African support appears to be moving to Bukova. Amb Killion has received a series of calls from African ambassadors as

You are scheduled to meet with the Danish Foreign Minister on Friday. The Danes are interested in partnering with the
US on a side event at the Kabul
Conference focused on Afghan women. I think this has potential and I'll raise with SRAP, but wanted you to know -- in
case it comes up in your meeting.
When I met with a couple of the Afghan women who participated in the recent peace jirga, they told me that it would
send a very strong message if a large group of women representing Afghan civil society could meet with you when you
are in Kabul for the conference. I don't know if it will be possible to arrange such a large gathering, but perhaps
something significant can be arranged.

    <body>AP - Rice defends Benghazi remarks
By: Associated Press
November 21, 2012 07:03 PM EST
U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice said Wednesday her early account of the attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and
three other Americans in Benghazi was based on the initial intelligence community assessments and was always subject
to review and updates.
She said she respected Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has been critical of her, but said &quot;some of the statements he's
made about me have been unfounded, but I look forward to having the opportunity at the appropriate time to discuss
all of this with him.&quot;
Her comments attributed the attacks to a mob enraged over an anti-Muslim video posted on YouTube were widely
denounced by Republicans during the U.S. presidential campaign. The attack came an the 11th anniversary of the Sept.
11, 2001, terror attacks on the United States, and her critics said it was clearly a terrorist attack timed to take place on
the anniversary.
The focus has fallen on her because she is a longtime White House insider and is believed to be President Barack
Obama's first choice to replace Secrretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is not expected to stay on during his second term.
Rice told reporters outside the U.N. Security Council: &quot;As a senior U.S. diplomat, I agreed to a White House request to
appear on the Sunday shows to talk about the full range of national security issues of the day, which at that time were
primarily and particularly the protests that were enveloping and threatening many diplomatic facilities, American
diplomatic facilities around the world, and Iran's nuclear program.&quot;
Hours before the Benghazi violence, a mob in Cairo attacked the U.S. Embassy there to denounce the videos as anti-
Islamic blasphemy. Killed in the Benghazi violence were Ambassador Chris Stevens, foreign service officer Sean Smith
and two former Navy SEALs, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods.
Rice said, &quot;The attack on our facilities in Benghazi was obviously a significant piece of this&quot; pattern.
&quot;When discussing he attack against our facilities in Benghazi, I relied solely and squarely on the information provided to
me by the intelligence community,&quot; she said.
&quot;I made clear that the information was preliminary, and that our investigations would give us the definitive answers,&quot;
she added.

Eap is asking you to call Thai foreign minister kasit regarding the case of the russian arms dealer viktor bout. Are you ok
doing this call in the next day or so?
Below is call sheet and I also faxed to the house.
Purpose of Call: To underscore the importance we place on a the Royal Thai Government's successful appeal of the
court decision rejecting the extradition of Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout to the United States and the importance of
his continued detention pending the outcome of the appeal.
Background: On August 11, 2009, a Thai judge denied a U.S. extradition request of accused arms smuggler Viktor Bout
(pron: BOOT) to face trial in New York for conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals and officers; acquire and use anti-aircraft
missiles; and provide material support to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The Thai Attorney
General's Office will appeal the ruling. FM Kasit has been a strong ally on Burma and released a forward-leaning
Chairman's statement on behalf of ASEAN following ASSK's conviction.

    <body>Under-Skin Defibrillators Seen Closer to Reality
By BARRY MEIER
The likelihood that patients in the United States may some day receive heart defibrillators that can operate without
electrical wires connected to their hearts has moved a step closer, according to a study published Wednesday.
The development of the new type of defibrillator has been long pursued by a researcher, Dr. Gust H. Bardy, at the Seattle
Institute for Cardiac Research in Seattle. And in the study in The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Bardy and other
researchers reported that initial trials of such a device in patients were successful.
Defibrillators fire an electrical jolt to interrupt a potentially fatal heart rhythm and restore normal beating. For a unit to
function, a surgeon must thread an electrical sensing wire through a blood vessel into a patient's heart. The wires pose
risks because they can, on rare occasion, puncture the heart during implantation or fracture while in place.
The new version delivers the electrical jolt by means of a sensor implanted under the skin near the chest bone. A power
unit is placed under the skin on the side of the chest.
The new device is already for sale in some European countries, but Dr. Bardy and others cautioned that full-scale, long-
term trials were still needed to prove the implant's worth to the Food and Drug Administration. Even if successful, the
unit could not be used by all patients who needed a defibrillator, but several researchers said they were excited by the new
study nonetheless.
Dr. Douglas P. Zipes, a professor at the Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis, said the new device could
someday displace existing models used in many patients Every month, about 10,000 patients in this country get a
defibrillator, either for the first time or as replacements for devices whose batteries have worn out.
In recent years, the safety of defibrillator wires has come in particular focus because a model made by Medtronic has been
prone to fracturing. Hundreds of patients who received the model have had to undergo new operations to replace it. Also,
scar tissue often builds up around intravenous wires, a process that can make removing and replacing them difficult or
dangerous.
Dr. Bardy said in a telephone interview that the deaths of several patients many years ago because of wire-related injuries
were a factor in his interest in developing the new device.
&quot;You are looking at a therapy that can avert, we hope, complications and be as effective,&quot; he said.
In the study published Wednesday, Dr. Bardy and others reported that the new device had undergone several successful
initial trials, including one in which it was used for a year in about 60 patients.
The device is being developed by Cameron Health, a small company in San Clemente, Calif., that was co-founded by Dr.
Bardy. Since the cardiologist began work on the project about a decade ago, the defibrillator he helped design has gone
through several iterations.
The device will not be suitable for a significant number of heart patients, particularly those who require units that also
include a pacemaker, which regulates a heart that is beating too fast or too slowly.
But Dr. Bardy estimated that the device could work in about 25 percent of patients who now get a defibrillator. These are
largely patients at risk, because of genetic factors or certain types of heart diseases, for a type of erratic cardiac rhythm

Sounds good. Huma and I will work to set it up. The budget issue is complicated -- we've had several discussions about
it. It's hard to put down numbers with confidence.
Call should be with Jack, Piper, Rich, Paul Jones, and Sean Misko.
Re the required report for Kerry-Lugar, I want to be sure that the language in both our report and this one echo the
same language.
Paul, Sean, and Rich are going back over to make sure of that. Our chief method is to use framing language from the

US major GE wins engine bid for Indian LCAs
NEW DELHI: US aircraft engine manufacturer (GE) Aviation today won the bid for supplying engines for the Indian
programme and the deal is estimated to be worth over $600 million.
GE pipped its European competitor Eurojet for the deal after DRDO, which is developing the LCA's mark II version,
formally announced that the American major's was the lowest bid in the tenders that saw a long-drawn battle for over
two years.
&quot;GE was declared as the lowest bidder&quot; by the Price Negotiating Committee headed by Chief Controller for Aerospace
systems Dr Prahlada.
&quot;The Prime Negotiating Committee for the alternate engine for LCA Mk 2 has finalised the comparative statement of
tenders...After evaluation and acceptance of the technical offer provided by both Eurojet and GE Aviation, the
commercial quotes were compared in detail and GE Aviation was declared as the lowest bidder,&quot; an official statement
from DRDO said in New Delhi.
The committee also had representatives from Defence Ministry, Defence Finance, Aeronautical Development Agency,
DRDO, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, Indian Air Force and Indian Navy.
&quot;Further price negotiations and contract finalisation will follow,&quot; the release added.
Though the order could be for 99 engines initially, will have the option of order for another 100 engines in the future.
GE had offered its GE F-414 engine as an alternative to its GE F-404 engines that are fitted in the first batch of LCAs that
IAF would receive in a couple of years from now.

Here's the update, pieced together from various sources:
Starting at around 3 pm Friday, Adams and McGuinness returned to Hillsborogh to meet with Robinson and Arlene
Foster. The four talked privately for several hours and then asked for the draft papers to review. The discussion
continued until around 1 am when the parties left Hillsborough. (Foster's presence is apparently very helpful. Her
relationship with the SF leaders is much more positive and direct, treating them as equal colleagues.)
Woodward and Irish FM Martin will meet with Adams and Robinson separately this afternoon to assess where the talks
are. The talks last night/early morning ended more positively and if that is still the case there may be a decision to push
on today to see if agreement can be reached. It is equally possible that the two ministers and DUP/SF will decide to
wind up today and resume on Monday.
Brown and Cowen have spoken this morning and will speak again late this afternoon.
The issue is still parades. Robinson needs some certainity of change on parades. It is important for him politically within
the DUP, but also externally since this has become a symbol of whether he has achieved something or compromised too
much. Adams and SF have moved very far from their original positions on parades, adding that Robinson has also

Gentle reminder about the Bob Barnett profile he emailed you about. Story is being written by David Montgomery of the
Washington Post, and is slated to run tomorrow - so we need to do this today, the earlier the better.
All you have to do is call into Ops when you're ready, they will connect you to the reporter (and add me in)
Here's the reporters description on the piece: &quot;...a large profile of Bob Barnett for the Style section. I know Barnett has
been a friend and counselor and campaign supporter over the years. I would like to ask Secretary Clinton her estimation
of what makes Barnett good at what he does, what he has meant to her in the various ways he has worked for her over
the years. And I would like to ask what she makes of how such a committed Democrat as Barnett is able to work so well
in his professional life for noted Republicans on book projects and other work. (A theme of the piece is how some say
Barnett harkens to a mythic time in Washington when players supposedly could more readily have relationships with

Any time between about 1 and 4 would be best if that works for you.
The draft as it stands now is a conglomeration of points from AMS, Jake, and me, but I wasn't able to write through the

1.Closing Wrap-up Video from Forum (produced by IIP and huge hit)

2.Thank-you Letter from Cameroon Delegate to Embassy
Dear All,
Good morning from Washington DC. I trust that we are keeping well. I just want to use this opportunity to say that today
we come to the end of the program here on the President's Forum. All along this Forum and especially during the White
House meeting with President Obama, I have been asking myself what it means to be here in DC and to be representing
Cameroon at this forum?
I have recently come to the realization that the time is critical and that President Obama in his thinking about a new
Africa believes that young people whom we are, diverse and intelligently different can take little positive actions to
ensure that the next 50 years witnesses significant changes in our social processes, our political institutions, processes
and structures, our economic freedom, taking into consideration our cultural specificities.
While traveling to America, I kept imagining the moment when President Obama would tell us great and magical ways to
getting out of our current socio-economic and especially political hostage situations, but in all and after all the speeches,
conversations and interactions with Ordinary Americans like in the Southside of Washington DC, State Department Staff,
Senators, Secretary of State Clinton and President Obama, I noticed that America can only partner with us when we
decide to start thinking and acting differently in our quest for a better Cameroon and a better Africa.
This thinking differently is exemplified by the American Peace Corps, in the service leadership, the spirit of give back to
the nation and community and the transformation of challenges to opportunities in America and in many nations
around the world...
When our troubles and challenges seems gruesome and our vision blurred by the thought and fear of the unknown if we
dared, the one thing I come out with from this Forum is this, &quot;That we just have to Think, Speak out and above all, DARE
take some innovative ACTIONs to Be the change we want to see in our communities, nations and continent and commit
others to same by our examples...That we have to build strong networks and undertake advocacies as a group as
nothing has ever stopped a committed group of people to drive change aound the world.

United States Institute of Peace: Background
Proposals for the creation of a government &quot;peace&quot; agency stretch as far back as a proposal in 1792 to create a &quot;Peace
Office&quot; on par with the War Department. Between 1935 and 1976 over 140 bills were introduced in Congress to
establish peace-related agencies, departments, bureaus, and committees of Congress. In 1979 Congress established the
Commission on Proposals for the National Academy of Peace and Conflict Resolution. In 1981, the Commission — known
as the Matsunaga Commission for its head, Senator Spark Matsunaga — recommended the creation of a national peace
academy. In 1984, President Reagan signed the United States Institute of Peace Act and the first meeting of USIP's Board
of Directors took place in 1986.
The USIP Act established &quot;an independent, nonprofit, national institute to serve the people and the Government
through the widest possible range of education and trainings, basic and applied research opportunities, and peace
information services on the means to promote international peace and the resolution of conflicts among the nations and
peoples of the world without recourse to violence.&quot;
USIP is an independent agency, funded by Congress, which serves as an intersection between those involved in policy
research, fieldwork, and practitioners. More than 70 USIP policy experts conduct research on a wide variety of country-
specific and cross-cutting functional issues. Some examples of USIP activities include:
® Working in countries such as Iraq, Sudan, Nigeria, Uganda, Pakistan, and Afghanistan to mediate and facilitate
dialogue among parties in conflict, promote the rule of law, strengthen civil society and education systems, and
educating the public through events, films, and other outreach.
O USIP has given out $58 million in grants for over 1,700 peacebuilding projects in 76 countries.
® USIP hosts standing working groups of experts and practitioners on a variety of issues, including Sudan, Syria,
Korea, Iran, Iraq, and Haiti.
® USIP has facilitated a number of task forces, including the Iraq Study Group and the recent Congressional

Kidnapped workers for Afghan female MP found dead
Fauzia Galani is one of the few female candidates standing for election in September
The bodies of five people working for a female candidate in Afghanistan's parliamentary election have been found in western Herat
province.
They were among a group of 10 people kidnapped by armed men on Wednesday. Five were later released, say reports.
The Taliban later said they carried out the abductions. No group has said it carried out the killings.
The staff were working for Fauzia Galani, who is seeking re-election to parliament in September's polls.
Police chief Nisar Ahmad Popal said the bodies had been found dumped on a mountainside in Adrskan district.
Reports say their hands had been bound and they had been shot in the head.
Taliban insurgents opposed to the elections in general - and female candidates in particular - have been blamed for the murder of a
number of candidates.
On Saturday, candidate Haji Abdul Manan was shot and killed as he was leaving a mosque on the back of a motorcycle.

The Secretary's Call Sheet for
Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari
Purpose of Call: To express your condolences regarding the deaths of Iraqi MFA personnel in the August 19 attack on
the Iraqi Foreign Ministry.
GI I want to personally express my heartfelt condolences to you for the savage attack on the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign
Affairs today and for the tragic loss of so many Iraqi lives around Baghdad and particularly at the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.
El I remember fondly our meeting at the MFA in April — I was proud to be the first senior U.S. official to attend a meeting
there, and I was deeply saddened to hear that your Ministry was attacked.
111This is a trying day for Iraqis and the Government of Iraq, but brutal attacks like these only deepen the need for
dedicated Iraqi like you and those in your Ministry, to remain committed to the new Iraq.
I Know that the United States will continue to stand by Iraq as it faces these challenges.
Background: On Wednesday, August 19, what appears to be a series of VBIED and additional rocket attacks in Baghdad
resulted in the bloodiest day in Baghdad since the June 30 withdrawal of U.S. forces from urban areas. Although exact
numbers have not been confirmed, media is reporting that approximately 75 people were killed across Baghdad with
over 100 injuries. The most devastating attack appears to have been against the Iraqi MFA, where a VBIED was
exploded in front of the main gate. Zebari's Chief of Staff estimated that there were 35-40 fatalities and up to 40
injuries resulting from this attack, with 70% of the building damaged. In April, you were the first senior U.S. official to
hold a meeting at the MFA. Deputy Foreign Minister Labid Abbawi, who attended your meeting at the MFA and who's

Subject: End of day Iraq wrap-up.
Today's tumultuous session of Iraq's COR culminated with the election and swearing in of Jalal Talabani as President,
and the immediate nomination of Nuni al Maliki as prime minister. Of more significance was the election of leading
Iraqiyya member Osama al-Nujayfi as speaker of the Council of Representatives. This represented Iraqiyya and Sunni
buy-in to the new, inclusive Government. As the newly nominated Prime Minister, Maliki now has 30 days to form the
Council of Ministers, which must be approved in the COR by absolute majority. 1.4(D)

These developments were marred by a theatric walkout by lraqiyya. Members of Iraqiyya had called for a motion to
cancel de-Baathification proceedings for Saleh Mutlaq and two others to be added to the COR agenda in advance of
voting on the presidency.

My guess is that he is calling about Honduras. He, like many other leaders with an interest in Central America, is worried
that Honduras is slipping towards confrontation and violence. He probably does not think Insulza is up to the task. S
should be aware that Arias is prepared to offer his services. I spoke with the Costa Rican FonMin, who said the de facto
government has reached out to Arias, and that the Costa Ricans will be looking for a way to make the offer to
Zelaya. Uribe knows Zelaya and has some influence. Uribe might want to talk with Arias and offer to help move Zelaya
in the right direction. (Although Uribe and Zelaya come from different ends of the political spectrum, they are both
ranchers and love horses, and this has created some comradeship.)

Cheryl —
Well, I finally made it. Quite a start to be able to ride in with the President in AF1 and then roll into meetings with
Calderon and the leadership of the Mexican government. I will spend this week in Mexico. I will be back next week to
pack out, but will also follow up on a number of other issues while I am there.
I wanted to ask if you thought it might be possible to get a bit of time with the Secretary. There are two requests going
through the system. One is for a formal swearing in. I understand that she has one swearing in at 4:00 on Monday in
the Ben Franklin room, so one option would be if she could do the same for me in the Treaty Room at 4:30. I know this
is short notice — this has been one of those cases where planning has alluded us.
The second request is for a meeting with the Secretary. I would very much appreciate the chance to go over priorities
moving forward, as well as provide a few initial observations.

Whenever you do something big on TV we all hear from lots of folks saying you did great. But this time is noticeably
different. First, people across the spectrum - DC insiders, reporters, staff, ex-staff, friends of friends, WH folks, etc -
were blown away. Second, people were REALLY moved by the last segment, three people even told me they teared up.
I'm guessing and hoping you hear this directly from random folks in the coming days.
And I think because it's been a lousy couple of weeks for the Admin, with mixed messages and bad news, coupled with
many people seeing you for the first time for an extended period talking about the job and your relationship with the
President, and that combo was probably the most powerful reminder since your speech in Denver that you're in a class
all your own (including the President who became enmeshed in the Gates incident)
That you didn't wait for the envoy question was key, you turned it into a strength. What you said about the President

    <body>TEHRAN (AP) — An Iranian-American businessman freed after more than two years in Tehran's main prison visited
survivors of a deadly 2008 mosque bombing as a condition of his release in a scripted event that could carry propaganda
value at home. Iranian authorities did not immediately explain their demand for 71-year-old Reza Taghavi to pay homage
in the southern city of Shiraz and personally acknowledge an attack in which he denies having any connection. But it
would fit neatly into possible Iranian attempts to squeeze multiple messages from Taghavi's October 16 release after 29
months in custody. Taghavi, accompanied by his wife and lawyer, fulfilled his pledge to visit the site of the mosque

SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED
JAMAICA
• Eric Boswell reported that the embassy and two international schools that U.S. dependent children attend are
closed today because of violence connected with the efforts to arrest the drug trafficker Coke. Consular Affairs
put out a new Travel Warning yesterday warning against travel to the Kingston area. DS has a heavy security
team on the ground.
CONGRESSIONAL ISSUES
• The Supplemental is on the Senate floor today. Not too many troublesome amendments yet. Not clear
whether Senator Landrieu will submit hers.
• Rich noted an effort to get State nominees approved this Thursday —6 are on the calendar, but two (Robert Ford
and Carmen Aponte) will not move for other reasons.
LEGAL ISSUES
• Harold noted that, if at all possible, he would like to brief the Secretary on the ICC Review Conference and the
&quot;crime of aggression&quot; issue before he leaves for the conference in Uganda this week.

Hi Huma.— could you please show this to the Secretary? Senator Reid's staff and Senator Lautenberg would like the
letter below sent to his office today. Upon receipt of the letter, we are told Senator Lautenberg will lift his hold on the
GSP and ATPDA trade legislation. I know the Secretary would prefer to wait until there is a final decision in Brazil, but it
is still unclear when that decision will come (may not even be today) and we have drafted the letter so that it still makes
sense regardless of how and when the court rules. Thanks, and I'm at my desk if she wants to discuss it further. Rich
Dear Senator Lautenberg,
I appreciated the opportunity to speak with you this past weekend regarding the custody case of Sean Goldman, the
young American boy wrongfully detained in Brazil for more than five years. As we discussed, the Administration has
long maintained that Sean should be reunited with his father David in New Jersey. I have made a point of emphasizing
this position with Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim during our many conversations, as have other U.S. Officials
with their Brazilian counterparts.
We have worked closely with the Government of Brazil to ensure it upholds its obligations under the Hague Convention
on International Child Abduction. We were quite concerned by last week's decision suspending the order reuniting Sean
with his father. We were encouraged, however, by the appeal filed last Friday by the Brazilian Solicitor General which
challenges this suspension. Like you, we are eager to learn of the outcome of this appeal. We understand a decision
could be announced shortly.
You can be assured that we will continue advocating for the reunification of Sean and his father and pressing the

Colleagues —
I have attached a Reuters report below about a U.S. national who has been arrested in Northern Afghanistan over a
shooting incident.
Ops spoke with Kabul ACS Chief Katie Nutt who said that this incident occurred on November 8. Kabul has kept CA/OCS
in the loop about the case. The man, who works for a NGO, has not yet been charged and is being held at a NDS
(National Directorate of Security) site in a private cell. He is being treated well and has hired an attorney from the
Consular Section's list. The Consular Section has kept in touch with him, and the Swedish-led PRT in Mazar-i-Sharif has
also been in contact.

U.S. aid worker held over Afghan boy's shooting
KABUL, Nov 11 (Reuters) - An American aid worker in northern Afghanistan is being held by Afghan authorities over the
fatal shooting of an Afghan teenager at his home, a provincial police chief said on Wednesday.
Mohammad Bilal Niram, chief of police in the northern Sar-i-pul province, said the aid worker had killed his landlord's
16-year-old son with three gunshots, possibly suspecting a burglary when the boy tried to enter his home.

Dear Cheryl,
I don't know who the Goodspot Production company is, but they certainly hit the &quot;sweet spot&quot; on this one. So
powerful, visually and the narration. I'm sending it all over the place.
The Secretary talked to Jim about the video (they ran into each other at National Airport, go figure).
We're going to send the link to all the House Hunger Caucus members and encourage them to put it on their
web sites.
In the meantime, knowing how much leisure time you have on your hands, and using Matt Damon as the &quot;link&quot;

UUP to vote against justice deal
Page last updated at 22:05 GMT, Monday, 8 March 2010 The Ulster Unionist Executive has endorsed the party's decision
to vote against the devolution of policing and justice powers to Northern Ireland.
The assembly is to vote on whether the powers should be devolved on Tuesday.
Earlier on Monday, the UUP accused Northern Ireland Secretary Shaun Woodward of political and emotional blackmail
ahead of Tuesday's vote.
Danny Kennedy said he had linked the vote to the anniversary of the murder of Constable Stephen Carroll.
The vote takes place exactly a year after the police officer was murdered by the Continuity IRA in Craigavon.
Mr Woodward said transferring justice powers on Tuesday would send an important message to those responsible for
his death and dissident republicans in general.
Bur Mr Kennedy, the UUP's deputy leader, said the secretary of state was guilty of &quot;political and emotional blackmail&quot;
and called on him to consider his position.
The UUP has been refusing to endorse the Hillsborough Agreement, insisting that matters such as education, parading
and &quot;the dysfunctional nature of the current executive&quot; must be addressed.
On Monday night, former DUP leader Ian Paisley said the UUP would be making a &quot;colossal mistake&quot; by not backing the
deal.
Mr Paisley was speaking to DUP members in Ballymena as he announced his retirement as MP for north Antrim.
The DUP selected his son, Ian Jnr, as its candidate in the forthcoming Westminster election at the same meeting.
Meanwhile,
It also suggested that 70% of unionists favour Northern Ireland politicians being in charge of policing issues, compared to
83% of nationalists.

Subject: Stevens update
Security: Today's focus is on the security situation in Benghazi. There is new local reporting that hotels are being
targeted. The INC conducted a raid on a house/storage facility and found and arrested an Egyptian cell reportedly there
for the purpose of attacking hotels. It is believed they were connected to the cell arrested last week, and that
Interrogation of those arrested earlier led to this round of arrests. Ahmed Qadafadarn, cousin of Qadhafi who was
envoy to Egypt (and was rumored to have defected), is purportedly the funder and organizer of this cell.
CA updated its travel guidance to tell travelers to stay away from the Fadihi Hotel. Stevens will inform the INC this
afternoon. [NOTE: for your reference, I appended the new WM at the end of this email.]
Stevens will be meeting with MFA in one hour and will make a written request for better security at the hotel and
for better security-related coordination. He still feels comfortable in the hotel. They are looking into the idea of moving
into a villa, but that is some way off. Need to consider resource requirements (would need TDY'er with authority to sign
lease, hire local guards, etc.). Based on discussion with DS yesterday, the hotel remains the safest location. Stevens will
continue to work to have the TNC post more people outside and beef up security presence. They have a good set back
and are way off the ground.
Flights: Stevens checked with head of the airport. There are no regular humanitarian or other flights, however,
there are flights coming in and the airport could support an air bridge if any country wanted to sat one up. Stevens will
see his European counterparts this afternoon and will ask how they are bringing in their people and whether we can be
part of it.
- Trip to Rome: Stevens doesn't know yet if Jai is going to Rome. As of now, he's inclined not to go but he might
change his mind. If the Department thinks he ought to go, Stevens can pass that message. As it stands now Mahmoud
Jabril and All Tarhouni will be going.
Misrata: Stevens spoke with Brig. Gen. Hassi re Misrata. The general was pretty dear that the ostensible move by
Qadhafi forces out of the area is a ruse. They are withdrawing troops so they won't be hit by NATO, but will send them
back in in civilian clothing so they can continue killing that way. Hassi said the assertion Qadhafi would leave to the
tribes to resolve was ridiculous because there are no armed tribes around.

address this.

Latest from Nairobi. Glenn is political counselor there.
1. This situation report is current as of 6:30 pm. It concludes Embassy Nairobi's Referendum situation reports.
2. Results from approximately 200 of 210 constituencies have been counted and final results should be announced
within the next hour. The &quot;Yes&quot; vote is about 5.5 million and the &quot;No&quot; vote is about 2.5 million. Final results should
show &quot;Yes&quot; with about 69 percent.
3. President Kibaki, Prime Minister Odinga, and Vice President Musyoka addressed a large crowd at the Kenya
International Conference Center at about 6:00 pm. Avoiding triumphalism , they struck themes of unity, reconciliation,
renewal, and building a new Kenya. After Odinga called for unity and paid tribute to Kibaki's leadership, Kibaki noted
that Kenya was coming to the end of an historic 20-year journey. The adoption of a new constitution was a victory for
those who had fought long and hard for a new constitutional dispensation that would usher in a new Kenyan nation. He
congratulated Kenyans on a successful and peaceful resolution of the constitutional process that showed that Kenya's
democratic institutions had come of age. Kibaki said he was particularly pleased with the transparent and efficient
conduct of the Interim Independent Electoral Commission. He called on all elements of Kenyan society to implement
the constitution. Referring to opposition to the constitution, Kibaki said their voices would be heard. Democracy was
about accepting the verdict of the majority, he said, while acknowledging space for the minority.
4. Earlier in the day, opposition leader William Ruto conceded defeat. He thanked the Kenyan people for their peaceful
participation in the process and specifically thanked the more than two million people who had resisted blackmail and

IRAQI NATIONAL ELECTIONS
I congratulate all the people of Iraq who participated in national elections today and over the past three days. There is
no better rebuke to the violent extremists who seek to derail Iraq's progress. Our thoughts and prayers are with the
families who lost friends and loved ones, and we salute the determination of the Iraqi people to reaffirm their
commitment to democracy and to charting their own future free of fear and intimidation.
Thanks to the efforts of the Iraq High Electoral Commission and the Iraqi Security Forces, which organized the voting and
ensured security at thousands of polling sites throughout the country, Iraqi men and women from all parts of the
country were able to go to the polls and choose their leaders freely.
I also would like to commend Ambassador Hill, General Odierno and all the U.S. civilian and military personnel who

CDM:
At behest of PDT, I tried to call you just minutes ago to ask about your availability for phone call from him this afternoon.
- First choice: 5:00 p.m. (your time)
- Alternative: 7:00 p.m.
- If neither works for you, then propose time and we'll accomodate.
Two options to suggest:
1.With our individual cell phones, it is difficult to involve third person - to wit, me. Could you arrange for a conference
type number and code to which PD and I could call separately? 1 .4(B)
2.Or as alternative, do you have capacity to call us separately to turn it into a conference call?
1 .4(D)
Either option would not only make for a smoother conversation, but would also allow me to not have to be in same Bi
location as PDT.

    <body>Isn't a surprise since 5 years ago he removed his brother as official crown prince.
Basically he's not honoring his fathers dying wish but since constitution says it should be son (with brother as option) he
has clear authority to do it. I personally think this shows confidence in his position as he's not worried about an outcry
from his fathers loyalists.

Hillary and Cheryl,
I'm feeling very good about our recent efforts to connect our speeches thematically. We've done it with development,
human rights, and Internet freedom; and most recently with AIPAC, Ctr for Middle East Peace, and next the AJC. Here's
what I want to suggest: The three most basic elements of human existence are food, water, and health. We have now
done major speeches on food and water. I'd like us to consider a major speech on global health — the third in a trilogy.

Subject: Palau offended by US positions
Below is the statement of very impressive Palau reps at the end of a session of required meetings on the next phase of
free association aid. FYI only, the Palauans were insulted by the nature and depth of the response to their proposal as
well as the content and the overall approach. They are even privately questioning the relationship. (This hasn't affected
their intent to take the Uighurs.) I will send a few further thoughts.
At the conclusion of yesterday's meeting, the Palau delegation caucused to discuss its reaction to the response of the
United States delegation to the proposals that it made in June in Washington D.C., and expanded upon in subsequent
communications.
While the Palau delegation has agreed to respond to certain additional questions raised by the United States delegation
on specific elements of the Palau proposal, and further has agreed to participate in certain working groups on specific
issues, the Palau delegation was deeply disappointed with the response of the United States delegation. The United
States delegation did not seriously respond, as required by the Compact, to the operational requirements of the
Government of Palau or to Palau's comprehensive and considered plans to achieve economic advancement and self-

SRI LANKA: RAJAPAKSA TO DECLARE VICTORY, IDP NEEDS GROW
(SBU) The government and NGOs are struggling to respond to the needs of 60-80,000 civilians who fled the
conflict zone since May 15 and are still arriving at IDP camps. Shelter, water, basic health care, and sanitation
are the most urgent needs among the 280,000 civilians now in overcrowded camps. UNSYG Ban will travel to
Sri Lanka May 22. The EU pushed for an independent investigation into alleged human rights violations in the
war, mainly over reported civilian deaths. Czech FM Kohout said the inquiry should be carried out by Sri
Lankan authorities, but could involve non-government and UN bodies. (Colombo 539, Reuters)
SOMALIA: ISLAMISTS CAPTURE PRESIDENT'S HOMETOWN
(SBU) Al-Shabaab seized the key town of Jowhar north of Mogadishu as pro-government militia deserted their
positions near the capital, media report. The government has lost control of most of south and central Somalia;
press report insurgents are heading toward the border town of Beledweyn near Ethiopia. The Transitional
Federal Government (TFG) requested support from other armed factions in the fight against al-
Shabaab. Embassy Nairobi comments the TFG plans to lobby Ethiopia for support at a May 20 regional
ministerial meeting. (Nairobi 1010, Reuters)
MALAWI: MAY 19 ELECTIONS TOO CLOSE TO CALL
(SBU) Parties are skeptical of the integrity of the electoral process, although the U.S. embassy and international

PAPUA NEW GUINEA: VIOLENCE TARGETS ASIAN BUSINESSES
(SBU) Attacks against ethnic Chinese-owned businesses have spread throughout the country since May 12,
with some localities reporting thousands of rioters, according to Embassy Port Moresby. Post adds the violence
demonstrates growing resentment of ethnic Chinese economic influence. The disturbances caught authorities
by surprise, and the government has not yet taken action against those involved, according to the Papua New
Guinea desk. The embassy comments the racial basis of the attacks is a new phenomenon in the country, where
the tribal fragmentation of society has kept such nationalist violence from occurring previously. (Ops/Papua

MEDIA NOTE
Joint Statement on the Upcoming Sudan National Elections
Following is the text of a joint statement by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas
Store, and United Kingdom Foreign Secretary David Miliband on the upcoming national elections in Sudan.
Begin Text:
National elections in Sudan this month will represent a major milestone in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement that
ended Sudan's twenty-two year civil war, and are an important opportunity for the people of Sudan to participate in the
political process.
We urge all parties in Sudan to work urgently to ensure that elections can proceed peacefully and credibly in April. We
are deeply concerned by reports of continued administrative and logistical challenges, as well as restrictions on political
freedoms. We call on the Government of Sudan, the National Elections Commission, and all political parties to engage in
further dialogue to resolve practical obstacles, procedural impediments, and address allegations of intimidation,
harassment, and safety concerns, and other legitimate concerns raised by various political parties. We continue to urge
the parties to improve conditions on the ground in Darfur and create a secure environment conducive to Darfur'
participation.
Irrespective of the outcome of elections, it is essential that work continues and is accelerated to meet remaining CPA
deadlines. Progress is needed urgently to complete border demarcation, to establish the commissions that will
supervise the referenda for the South and Abyei, to conduct popular consultations in Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan,

Cheryl,
One sappy statement before I fly. Your involvement in the QDDR process has always been extremely helpful. Most of the
best QDDR chairs meetings were those in which you participated, due in large part to the rigor and critical thought you
brought to every issue. From the beginning of the process, your critical analysis and thoughtfulness in these meetings
made all of us think more deeply. I have been grateful for that approach many times throughout the QDDR.
We've come a long way since that first meeting in which I described this as a &quot;capabilities review&quot; and organizational
change exercise — all met with some frustration or blank stares. I think we've ended this phase on a great note. The
amount of positive feedback we've received and the eagerness to start implementation are great signs heading into
implementation.
You are clearly one of the hardest working people in this building and have done so much to define and implement the
Secretary's vision on so many things. So thanks for everything you've done on the QDDR and for everything else you do.
As discussed today, I'm not far away if you need anything.

Subject: McCain update
The Watch received the following readout of CODEL McCain's Apri123 meetings in Cairo.
Foreign Minister Alaraby:
McCain discussed his visit to Libya, emphasizing it appeared a stalemate was emerging. McCain supported the
decision to send in predator drones and would like NATO to provide equipment, as well as training, to the rebel
forces. McCain characterized the TNC as &quot;good people,&quot; but said its military was far less impressive.
Regarding the possibility of Egypt increasing aid to the TNC, Alaraby said Egypt was reluctant to provide additional
support out of concern for the estimated 1 million Egyptian nationals living in Libya.
Alaraby reiterated Egypt is in no rush to restore diplomatic relations with Iran.
Alaraby said Egypt will abide by all agreements made with Israel. He encouraged the United States to support, or
at least not oppose, recognition of Palestinian statehood in the UN.
McCain said the USG had discussed a modest assistance package for Egypt, but warned it was probably more
modest than Egypt wished given the current economic climate. McCain planned to organize a group of businessmen to
visit Egypt and encouraged Alaraby to create a more pro-business environment.
Defense Minister, Field Marshall Tantawi:
The meeting focused on Libya and strategies to increase U.S. and Egyptian assistance. The discussion was not as in
depth as McCain's meeting with the FM. Tantawi echoed Alaraby's concern about Egyptian nationals in Libya and
request for increased U.S. assistance.

Subject: Funeral of Pres. Aquino - Potential Presidential Delegation
All,
EAP is still waiting on confirmation on whether former Philippines President Aquino's funeral will be a private affair or
whether it will be necessary to send a presidential delegation.
In preparation for a presidential delegation, EAP has recommended the following individuals to serve as delegates.
Let me know if anyone should be added or removed from this list.
1)George Schultz, former Secretary of State (to head delegation)
2)Sen Richard Lugar
3)Sen Daniel Inouye
4)Amb Michael Armacost: currently a fellow at Stanford, served as Ambassador to the Philippines from 1982-1984
5)Amb Nicholas Platt: former foreign service officer, served as Ambassador to the Philippines from 1987-1991
6)Amb Frank Wisner: served as Vice Chairman for AIG until retiring in Feb 09, served as Ambassador to the Philippines
from 1991-1992
7)Richard Armitage: former Deputy Secretary of State; involved in the Valerie Plame scandal after acknowledging that
he was the one responsible for leaking Plame's name to the press
8)Rep Steve Austria (R-OH): first Filipino-American congressman
9)A/S Kurt Campbell

advice on how to deal with its smaller neighbor. President Bashar al-Assad Assad told al-Hayat newspaper in an
interview published last week that the U.S. &quot;created chaos in every place it entered.&quot; Two days later the U.S.

of you for a great event. On the video, just hope it got to a point where you were happy with it. That said, I also wanted
to say that the streaming on State.gov and America.gov went very well yesterday and received a lot more praise then
the UN one which required people to download software, which ours did not. :)
Also, we are working now to send the video out to posts and to let them use in their own story telling. Also, we had a
gadget created to help promote the event which has been featured on several sites and we are continuing to push out
which encourages people to keep up to date on news on Haiti and to donate to the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund.

Secretary Clinton,
I hope that all is well back in the States and just wanted to let you know that I will be in Washington
Wednesday. If you might have a minute to spare to follow up on your last message in person or by phone this

Kurt and Cheryl,
In my meeting yesterday with FM Smith, he said he'd still like to speak with S. Originally, they were scheduled
to talk last Friday but it was cancelled. Given the change in leadership, and Smith's increased responsibility --
taking on trade and aid portfolios as well as foreign affairs -- I think a brief call would be helpful.
Also, I spoke at length with former PM Rudd on Monday. Although he did not raise the issue, his aide called

Department of State Ranks High as Employer for HBCU Students and
Alumni
Washington, DC
October 26, 2009
In the current edition of HBCU Connect, the Department of State placed among the top five employers for Historically Black
Colleges and University (HBCU) students and alumni. The Department of State is the highest-ranking Federal agency, listed
under first-ranked McGraw-Hill, second-ranked Continuum Health Partners, and third-ranked State Farm.
HBCU Connect's ranking of best employers is based on the following criteria: HBCU student and alumni recruitment, brand
penetration in HBCU communities, relationship with HBCU organizations, consistency in outreach efforts, types of positions
made available, and messaging used to reach audience.
It is worth noting that the Department of State ranked:
• first as best federal employer for HBCU students and alumni
• fourth as best employer for HBCU students and alumni

Dear Melanne,
The US Ambassador to UNESCO is launching a fierce, ferocious, unfair campaign against the
Egyptian candidate to UNESCO Minister Farouk Hosni.
If Washington does not want him — for whatever reasons — this is acceptable as their choice, but
we think the US, with its principles and weight, should be a fair partner and an objective leader.
People here am surprised at the position of the US Ambassador. They say &quot;We want to feel that
change is not just a Motto but starts a new era in our relationship&quot;
Hosni is an open-minded person who respects all religions. He is
accused of being Anti-Jewish. That is not true. The allegation is based
on a quote out of context. He is translating Hebrew literature, restored
Synagogues and is establishing a Jewish Museum. He rescued the torah
scrolls and has the symbols of the three religions appear together in
Video Clips, Pictures and documentaries about Egypt.
For these, and similar reasons, the fundamental — Terrorists are against him and are the ones
7Torkilg hard to block his election.

Despite the nailbiting finale, the Human Rights Council reentry has been remarkably successful. The tally, with returns
still coming in:
1. Goldstone-report deferred through extraordinary political work by all of you 2. Freedom of Expression--tonsensus--a
landmark achievement in suggesting that there is indeed a universal understanding of freedom of expression that can
cut across cultural lines 3. Honduras: consensus 4. Womens' Equality-consensus 5. Human Security issues: US took
forward leaning posture USG engaged across the board and got the results it wanted--5 for 5--plus appeared principled
and balanced To be honest if we had gotten any 2 of these, I would have felt relieved. Instead we ran the table. There
was a stunning performance by 10-DRL-L-AmEmbassy Geneva and various regional bureaus, particularly NEA and WHA
and AF, as well as EUR. The State Department at its finest and multilateral diplomacy executed at a macro and micro
level. Brimmer, Nossel, Posner all were outstanding as were our folks in Geneva.
And this is in our first reengagement. It should get better as we gain more experience.

    <subject>Palau release on free association meeting</subject>
    <body>Below is Palau's statement on the recent meeting in the required free association review. The fourth is the key
paragraph. Jake, I'll call. Jeff 202-343-2905 o,
A Compact of Free Association replaced the United States administration of Palau, islands which the U.S. took in war and
subsequently administered for the United Nations. The Compact, which was signed in 1986 and took effect October 1,
1994, includes provisions of various duration. Some are to last at least 50 years, including full U.S. military authority --
although the power of the U.S. to deny access to Palau and its extensive waters by the military of any other nation is to
continue in perpetuity.
The amounts and types of U.S. budgetary and programmatic assistance to Palau under the Compact are specified for 15
years, but the Compact requires reviews of its terms and the entire relationship on its 15th, 30th, and
40th anniversaries. The reviews are to consider the operating requirements of the Government of Palau and the islands'
development. The Compact also commits the U.S. to acting on the findings and to promoting Palau's long-term economic
development.
A Palauan delegation that included Vice President Kerai Mariur, Chief Representative for Compact Review Joshua
Koshiba, Minister of Health Dr. Stevenson J. Kuartei, Palau Community College President Dr. Patrick Tellei, Ambassador
to the U.S. Hersey Kyota, Representative to the United Nations Stuart Beck, and their consultants met in Honolulu on July
8-9 in connection with the 15th Anniversary Review with an American delegation that included Department of State Office
of Australia, New Zealand, and Pacific Islands Affairs Alcy Frelick, the head of the US Delegation, and representatives of
the Departments of the Interior and Defense and the Weather and Postal Services.
The U.S. delegation made positive statements on a few matters and agreed to discuss some others further. A number of
the U.S. delegation's statements, however, evidenced a need for greater study by some U.S. officials of the intent as well
as the letter of the Compact, the relationship as a whole, Palau's economic situation and fiscal responsibility
commitments, and Palau's contributions to the U.S. and to international harmony -- including sacrifice by Palauans in the
U.S. military, the UN international peacekeeping force and Palau's strategic location and posture, and Palau's positions in
the U.N.
Palau is grateful for its partnership with the U.S. and wants to continue in the association as called for by the Compact,
deepen the relationship, and develop its capacities as a freely associated state. It appreciates the more positive
expressions of U.S. Secretaries of State Clinton and of the Interior Salazar and congressional leaders of both political
parties. Palau fully trusts that reflection will result in an approach to the relationship consistent with the Compact and to
positions befitting the great nation that is the United States.
Recognizing that the questions of the association are relatively small and unique for the Government of the U.S. and that

Subject: Andy Young
Happy New Year. I hope you got some time to enjoy the holiday season and could relax before getting back at it this
year.
Andy Young is a very good friend of mine, and has been a stalwart for the Clintons over the years. He is also one of the
most recognized and respected experts on Africa in America. He asked me today if I thought it would be appropriate for
him to seek to see the Secretary to share some of his thoughts on Africa and current issues being confronted there. I
told him of course and suggested that he reach out to you to try to arrange that dialogue. Hopefully that is ok from your
perspective. Andy is a thoughtful, remarkable and decent man. If you don't know him you will enjoy getting to know
him. Thanks and maybe one of these days when I am in DC we can grab a coffee together. Cheers.

- I don't want to get overconfident but we had a very good week on the Expo. Pepsi at $5M, Microsoft at $1M, Corning

- Great mtg today at GE with about 20 corporations. 15 said they would look at it seriously. I think this has turned

Get well.

ALL: Police/Military have blocked vehicle traffic to the Airport. Not allowing groups of
pedestrians to pass. Apparently they are prepared to prevent Zelaya supporters to gather
at the airport. Z supporters from outside Tegucigalpa slept at University Pedagogica in
the outskirts of the city last night where they will begin their march today. Zelaya and
his supporters have been encouraging Zelaya supporters from the interior to come into the
capital and support Zelaya's arrival. Many of these are rural poor and indigenous from
his popular strongholds in the Departments of Copan Intibuca, and Lempira. We also know
that many bus loads of Z supporters are coming in from his home province of Olancho.

Statement by the Secretary
The Death of Polish President Kaczynski and His Delegation
I join President Obama in offering my deepest condolences to the people of Poland, to the Kaczynski family, and to the
families of all those killed in this tragedy. Lost alongside President Kaczynski and his wife were Polish leaders from
across the political spectrum, men and women who shaped and sped Poland's post-1989 democratic transformation and
were leading Poland into its promising future. The tragedy of these lives cut short will be felt deeply across the world,
but their legacy will live on in a free and flourishing Poland.
The United States stands with the Polish people in this difficult hour. Like the country he led, President Kaczynski was
one of America's most valued and trusted allies. He was well known in the United States as a champion for democracy

Kurt:
You'll be happy to know that the Secretary's video message was the subject of a great op-ed in today's Thai Rath, the
leading newspaper in Thailand. They took exactly the line that we hoped they would — seeing her message not as the
U.S. intervening in politics, but, rather, as a very personal message from someone who cares deeply about Thailand. The
writer even referred to the Secretary's autobiography.
Thai Rath (leading Thai language daily), a commentary on Thai politics, April 16, referenced Secretary Clinton's video
statement calling for a peaceful solution to Thailand's political crisis: &quot;I would like to thank U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton for making a request herself and on behalf of President Obama for the two opposing parties to return to the
negotiating table so as to end their conflict. The short video message in which she mentioned Thailand was full of
sincerity. She started by saying that she was making this request as &quot;a long-standing friend of the Thai people&quot; She
referred to the Songkran festival which is the Thai New Year and said the opposing parties should consider this an
opportunity for a new round of talks. She emphasized that violence cannot bring happiness and peace and that the
opposing parties should talk in order to solve the problem. I believe Mrs. Clinton said this with sincerity. I have read a
book in which she wrote about her brief visit to Thailand as First Lady several years ago and showed her goodwill toward

LAWMAKER EXPECTS CLINTON TO SOON FIX GAY INEQUITIES AT STATE DEPT.
On Monday I posted that Rep. Howard Berman had introduced the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2010
and 2011 (H.R. 2410) late last week, which covers a broad range of foreign policy and diplomacy issues, one of which is to
&quot;end the long-standing practice of excluding the committed partners of Foreign Service officers from the benefits routinely
provided to the spouses and children of officers serving abroad.&quot;
q12-oday, news of developments in that area: &quot;Berman, in a hearing on funding for the Foreign Service, said he would drop •
his legislative bid as 'it is my expectation, based on very recent conversations, that the Secretary of State will move forward
with implementing all of the benefits provided in that provision in the very near future.' The congressman invited to the
hearing Michael Guest, the former US ambassador to Romania who in 2007 left the Foreign Service, citing unfair treatment of
his partner.&quot;
In February, Rep. Tammy Baldwin sent a letter co-signed by Senators Russ Feingold and Ron Wyden, and Rep. Ileana Ros-
Lehtinen to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asking that inequities be remedied. Clinton said that such remedies were &quot;on a

INTERVIEWS: DEAN DEBNAM 888-621-6988 / 919-880-4888 (serious media

QUESTIONS ABOUT THE POLL: TOM JENSEN 919-744-6312
Senate Race Competitive
Raleigh, N.C. — The race to replace Ted Kennedy in the US Senate is looking like a toss
up, with Republican Scott Brown up 48-47 on Martha Coakley.
Brown is benefiting from depressed Democratic interest in the election and a huge lead
among independents for his surprisingly strong standing. Those planning to vote in the
special election only report having voted for Barack Obama in 2008 by a 16 point
margin, in contrast to his actual 26 point victory in the state.
That decline in turnout from Obama voters plagued Democratic candidates for Governor
in Virginia and New Jersey last fall. Beyond that 66% of Republicans say they're 'very
excited' about turning out while only 48% of Democrats express that sentiment.
Brown leads 63-31 with independents and is winning 17% of the Democratic vote while
Coakley receives only 6% support from GOP voters. Both candidates are relatively
popular, with 57% viewing Brown favorably to only 25% unfavorable and 50% with a
positive opinion of Coakley to 42% negative.
Those folks planning to vote in the special election are actually opposed to Obama's
health care plan by a 47/41 margin and only narrowly express approval of the President's
overall job performance 44/43.
&quot;The Massachusetts Senate race is shaping up as a potential disaster for Democrats,&quot; said
Dean Debnam, President of Public Policy Polling. &quot;Martha Coakley's complacent

Erekat: PA to ask UN to recognize state soon
Chief negotiator says Palestinians will submit request as soon as Bosnia take over Security
Council presidency. 'Israeli government is witnessing an international isolation that it hasn't
witnessed before,' he says
The Palestinians will ask the United Nations Security Council to unilaterally recognize an independent Palestinian
state within the 1967 borders early next month, chief negotiator Saeb Erekat was quoted as saying by the Maan
News Agency Wednesday.
Speaking to reporters in the West Bank town of Jericho, Erekat said the Palestinians are waiting for Bosnia to take
the presidency of the Security Council before submitting the proposal.
&quot;The Israeli government is witnessing an international isolation that it hasn't witnessed before,&quot; Erekat added. &quot;And
this is due to the efforts exerted by the Palestinian leadership and by President Mahmoud Abbas.&quot;
According to the report, Erekat expressed hope that the US would not veto the proposal, and also called for South
Korea, Japan, New Zealand and Australia to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state.
Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador and Bolivia have all recognized a Palestinian stare over the past few weeks.

    <body>I have asked Jose to get you a more detailed report but I.must tell you the opening of the USA Pavilion has been a great
success so far - at least among the expo-goers. A few vignettes.
- while we don't want to brag to our Chinese hosts, our Pavilion has become the most popular. During the trial runs last
week, the Chinese expo-goers rushed directly from the gates to the USAP (and even broke some of our turn-styles).
Needless to say, the Chinese have improved security. On EACH of the first two days, 30,000 pple visited. Lines are long
and pple are loving the show. We are also getting many foreign officials to visit.
-the 100 US college student ambassadors (who act as guides and speak Mandarin) are the biggest hits of the pavilion.
Fair-goers stand in line to have their photo's taken w them. They explain the show and send a great message.
- the story line that we thght was simplistic is quite popular (the overture where Americans try to say hello in mandarin
is met w howls of laughter and Act ll called the Garden is doing well). During the thunderstorm scene a mist comes from
the ceiling and some pple put up their umbrellas. Act I is a bit too commercial but the audience claps and take photo's
when you and President come on the screen.
- we are selling tons of USA merchandise - the two most popular items - mini-basketballs with the USAP seal on it and
the bison stuffed animals - who knew?
Anyway, thght u'd enjoy the quick report. I cannot imagine us not being here! We will keep you posted.
Smart power works!

From Foster Care To Law School Graduate, Howard University
Student Beats The Odds
Jelani Freeman lived in 6 foster homes in 10 years
Updated: Friday, 07 May 2010, 8:25 PM EDT
Published : Friday, 07 May 2010, 7:55 PM EDT

WASHINGTON - Jelani Freeman has gone through a lot to wear this robe. This weekend, he will graduate from Howard University Law
School.
He remembers the shaky foundation of his young life. A mother who could not take care of him. He lived in six foster homes in ten
years.
&quot;Moving to these different homes. The kids were like 'you weren't here yesterday.' Where's your mom at'?&quot; said Freeman.
At 18 years old, he left the system and went to college in search of room and board. He knew what people expected of kids in the foster
care system - not much.
&quot;All I would hear is that they were in jail or homeless or weren't doing too well,&quot; said Freeman.
He beat the odds and graduated, but he felt ... alone.
&quot;I can distinctly remember walking across the stage in undergrad. You know at graduation everyone has their cheer section that yells as
you walk across the stage and there was almost silence as I walked across,&quot; said Freeman.
It will be different this time. When Freeman gets, his diploma Saturday at the convention center, there will be 26 people - friends and
supporters from as far away as California - in D.C. to show their support.
Freeman also got a boost from an internship program for kids who have spent time in foster care. He was placed in the office

official Palestinian report asserting the Western Wall, one of Judaism's holiest sites, is not Jewish. Al-Mutawakil Taha,
deputy information minister in the Palestinian Authority, published a five-page study disputing Jews' reverence of the
shrine as a retaining wall of the compound of Biblical Jewish Temples destroyed centuries ago. &quot;Denial of the
connection between the Jewish people and the Western Wall by the Palestinian Authority's Ministry of Information is
baseless and scandalous,&quot; Netanyahu said in a statement issued by the prime minister's office. &quot;The Israeli government
expects the leaders of the Palestinian Authority to renounce the document and condemn it, and to stop twisting
historical facts,&quot; he said. In the report, Taha wrote the Western wall is a &quot;Muslim wall and an integral part of al-Aqsa

and in peace, he fought for what he knew was right, even when it was unpopular. He was a fierce advocate for working
families struggling with a changing economy and for better health care and equipment for servicemembers. And over
the course of more than three decades in Congress, he became one of our nation's most respected voices on national
security and foreign policy. Presidents of both parties sought his advice and generations of colleagues looked to him for

peace essay contest in the 90s, and they are doing great things -- one is a teacher, one is a police officer. They are now
reaching out to get permission for you to tell their stories tomorrow night; assuming they will grant it, I am writing up
their stories now and will fax a revised draft to you shortly.

Dear Ms. Mills:
It may be inappropriate for me to do this and if so I apologize in advance but I thought Secretary Clinton might want to
know, and probably didn't, about terminal illness. My understanding is that the Clintons' and
paths crossed in Arkansas politics in the past and in a friendly way.
I know all of this because I am originally from Little Rock, and have been told of
friend who teaches at UALR and knows Additionally,
the state legislature for a decade or so, was my undergraduate advisor at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock in the
1960s.
I am emailing you in your capacity as the Secretary's chief of staff.
Again, my apologies if this is something I shouldn't have done.

I would like to keep this close hold please:
Former Panamanian VP/FM Sam Lewis just called to say he and former President Torrijos have been talking informally to
Presidents Colom, Funes and Ortega. He said all three are concerned about finding a way forward in Honduras and that
they realize elections must be part of the picture. They think the president-elect of Honduras will have a chance to
pursue national reconciliation, including a unity government. They also said the region needs better mechanisms to
head off coups and wondered about amending the IADC.
I told Sam about our step by step package approach and the vital role of elections in that package. Keep an eye out for
our statement today, I added. We have always believed in changing the Honduran dynamic one move at a time -- he
agreed. I noted that many Hondurans have talked of an eventual national dialogue to address social inclusion. Sam said

Cheryl. What happened this past couple of weeks has been amazing. We've been working with the Haitians and the
Hansolls, trying to put everything together for months now. Since your appearance on the scene, things have caught
amazing speed and vertigo, and having President Clinton and you chair today's ceremony has been an honour and
privilege. We still have to deliver more than promises, but the motivation you've brought into the Haitian and our own
teams is just tremendous, so I am extremely optimistic about the outcome and our capacity to do things on time.

Ops - Following Secretary Clinton's call on Saturday, May 16, Philippine Foreign Secretary Alberto Romulo had the
Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) issue the following statement on Sunday, May 17. The statement is on the
Philippine DFA website. Much appreciated if you would inform S staff and other appropriate folk:
Philippine Statement:
The Philippine Government is deeply troubled and outraged over the filing of trumped up charges against Daw Aung San
Suu Kyi and her transfer to Insein prison, particularly when concerns have been raised regarding her health condition.
These recent incidents will surely impede the process of national reconciliation and the Roadmap to Democracy in
Myanmar.
We urge the government of Myanmar to resolve the matter speedily, and to release Aung San Suu Kyi immediately and
unconditionally.
Regards

Rumor is that, with elecitons behind them, he may be moved to (get this!) the health ministry. He's mum on subject,

Thank you for your too kind words which were a greatly welcome addition to my healing and rehab. My word of advice

Madam Secretary-
I hope you, the President and Chelsea had a great Thanksgiving. Hopefully things will wind down and you'll be able to
spend some time with your family. As you know, I'm being honored by the American Friends of the Hebrew University
on Thursday, March 11, 2010. I'd be so honored if you would consider being the keynote speaker. I've had some
correspondence with Lona in your office and she indicated you may have a better idea of your 2010 calendar in early
November. It would mean the world to me if you could do it, but if not I completely understand.
I look forward to seeing you soon.
All my best,
Terry

I think I mentioned to you that Carols Pascual has asked me to work with him on a public awareness campaign targeting
the Mexican public and designed to maintain support for the campaign against the drug cartels. The attached article,
which he wrote, addresses this issue. I have approached Keith Reinhard at Business for Diplomatic Action to work with
us on this matter. Keith thinks he can organize a US/Mexican creative coalition to work on it. Might be an interesting
model for Haiti if it works here.

Jim, Cheryl and Bill:
We have a Congressional issue that is moving a bit too slowly through the building that you should know
about. Rep. Steve Rothman (D-NJ) and Senator Lautenberg have contacted us alarmed by the news that
Qaddafi will come to UNGA and allegedly overnight at the residence of the Libyan PermRep in
Englewood.. Rothman has called our office directly and threatened holy war and Fox news &quot;if the State
Department allows this.&quot; A few minutes ago we also got a letter from Sen. Lautenberg to the Secretary
expressing similar concerns. The anger is of course over the &quot;hero's welcome&quot; for Megrahi. An action memo
for Jim to consider on how to deal with Qaddafi's visit is in the works, but I fear Rothman will head for the
microphones before Jim gets the memo.

SECURITY COUNCIL PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT ON THE RECENT INCIDENT IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN
The Security Council deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries resulting from the use of force during the Israeli military
operation in international waters against the convoy sailing to Gaza. The Council, in this context, condemns those acts
which resulted in the loss of at least ten civilians and many wounded, and expresses its condolences to their
families. The Security Council requests the immediate release of the ships as well as the civilians held by Israel. The
Council urges Israel to permit full consular access, to allow the countries concerned to retrieve their deceased and
wounded immediately, and to ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance from the convoy to its destination. The
Security Council takes note of the statement of the UN Secretary—General on the need to have a full investigation into
the matter and it calls for a prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation conforming to international
standards. The Security Council stresses that the situation in Gaza is not sustainable. The Council re-emphasizes the
importance of the full implementation of Resolutions 1850 and 1860. In that context, it reiterates its grave concern at
the humanitarian situation in Gaza and stresses the need for sustained and regular flow of goods and people to Gaza as
well as unimpeded provision and distribution of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza. The Security Council

H: First review of your speech. Goad you used Acheson. Sid
aary's Homerun of a Speech
by Tunku Varadarajan
September 8, 2010 I 12:16pm
Clinton speaks at the Council on Foreign Relations September 8, 2010 in Washington,
,
DC. (Mark Wilson / Getty Images) The secretary of State delivered the best speech of the Obama
administration this morning. Tunku Varadarajan on her &quot;new American moment&quot;—and why she's
better than her boss.
Behold the Hillary Doctrine. And heap abundant gratitude—and rose petals if you have them on hand—on the firm,
unfussy, deeply reassuring woman who has just offered it up to the world.
In the 20 months since this administration began administering (a verb I use only in the loosest sense), the speech
Wednesday morning by Hillary Clinton, delivered at the Council on Foreign Relations, was the first time we have been
given an unreserved lift of the heart by any of its members. It was, by far, the best speech of this administration. Whereas
her president has frequently wrung his elegant hands, doing the rounds of the world to reassure foreign leaders that
America is a cuddly bunny at heart, the secretary of State declared Wednesday that we are all living &quot;a new American
moment—a moment when our global leadership is essential.&quot; There was no bowing from her to potentates in robes; there
was, instead, a promise that &quot;we will do everything we can to exercise the traditions of American leadership at home and
abroad.&quot;
What is so piquant here is not the fact that Hillary understands that Obama is president. It is the growing sense that Hillary
would have made a much, much better president than Obama.
Try this for size: &quot;The United States can, must and will lead in the new century.&quot; In order to do that, Clinton promised &quot;a
new global architecture,&quot; &quot;built to last and withstand stress.&quot; And in a muscular departure from the way in which this
administration—for fear of seeming Bush-like—has been shrinking from the unembarrassed propagation of American
values, she uttered these plainspoken, unadorned words: &quot;Democracy needs defending.&quot;
X
Human rights, too, came in for a robust airing: China was scolded, and exhorted to follow &quot;the rules of the road&quot; in its
aspiration to be a great power; as was Russia, for its invasion of Georgia. The message: We may live in a multipolar
world, but we have higher standards by far than those who would style themselves as our equals.
Clinton used phrases like &quot;American might,&quot; words that we are more accustomed to hearing from Republicans—words
that we've come to believe that many Democrats can't bear to voice. How refreshing, therefore, that she should reach into
a vocabulary of pride that most American citizens would applaud.
Hillary Clinton invoked the name of Dean Acheson in her reference to the need for &quot;good, old-fashioned diplomacy,&quot; and
there certainly was an air of the Achesonian, of the statesman, about her speech. Good, old-fashioned diplomacy, it
should be noted, is in contrast to Obama's apparent preference for seeing America as a nation like any other, only a bit
bigger, richer, and better-armed. Clinton's &quot;old-fashioned&quot; diplomacy is based, by contrast, on the unquestionable premise
that America is the world's leader. Not primus inter pares; just primus.
In her speech, Clinton referred to the sources of &quot;American might.&quot; The first, of course, is &quot;economic power.&quot; But it is her
hailing of the second—America's &quot;moral authority&quot;—that was so invigorating.
It was Acheson who said: &quot;The most important aspect of the relationship between the president and the secretary of state
is that they both understand who is president.&quot; What is so piquant here, in this administration, is not the fact, plain to
behold, that Hillary understands that Obama is president. It is the growing sense that Hillary would have made a much,
much better president than Obama.

Hobbs Carpenter Fellow in Journalism at Stanford's Hoover Institution and a professor at NYU's Stern Business School.

    <body>Hi Cheryl,
The U.S.-China dialogue on Latin American issues began in 2006 during the Bush administration, led by Tom Shannon,
and recurred in 2007 and 2008. My trip to China will be the first such dialogue to take place during the Obama
administration
China is
now a top-three trading partner of many Latin American countries and is in fact the number one trading partner of Brazil,
as well as being a donor member of the Inter-American Development Bank and observer at the Organization of American
States.
The purpose of these talks is three-fold: to inform the Chinese of our policy priorities in the Americas, to learn about their
views on the region, and to explore potential areas of cooperation in the areas of economic and social development. In
addition to the formal meetings with government officials, I will also be meeting with Latin American diplomats, Chinese
academics and private sector groupings.
Our dialogue with China on Latin America is one of three sub-dialogues that are part of the broader U.S.-China strategic
framework to ensure that the bilateral relationship is positive, cooperative, and comprehensive. The others are the China-
Africa talks that AF hosted in Washington last month and the dialogue on South and Central Asia.

Mike, I write to ask a personal favor. An old friend of mine named David Ramage died earlier
this week David was for many years the president of the
New World Foundation. During that period the Secretary served on the board of the foundation
and worked with David. His family would like the Secretary to be informed of David's
death. Incidentally when I worked at the NSC I walked David over to the White House for a
private meeting with the First Lady which was just the two of them. I can provide additional
details on the memorial service if she were interested but the family's concern was only that she
be informed. Mort

Gordon Brown called Lou Susman a short while ago. Brown believes you should make a call to McGuinness this morning
around 830 am (DecIan and I agree that if you call McG you also must call Robinson). Brown proposes to speak with you
at 820 or so to bring you up to speed before those calls.
The current situation is that Brown and Cowen are in Belfast, and met with Robinson, McGuinness, and other parties
until 330 in the morning Belfast time. They have now resumed today. The sticking point is parades. Robinson wants the
current parades commission abolished because it gives Republicans too much say. McGuinness refuses to allow the
parades issue to be tied to the devolution issue.

If our early assessment of today's election in Honduras holds, we will have just been witness to a remarkable thing:
Honduran voters have taken back their democracy from two failed leaders -- Zelaya and Micheletti -- who had driven
Honduras to isolation and despair.
The turnout (probably a record) and the clear rejection of the Liberal Party shows our approach was the right one, and
puts Brazil and others who would not recognize the election in an impossible position. As we think about what to say, I
would strongly recommend that we not be shy. We should congratulate the Honduran people, we should connect

Report: Obama's national security team
'incredibly weak'
Wed, 11/04/2009 - 1:45pm
Despite an expansion of the National Security Council staff, coordination of national security policy is still dysfunctional
and there is a lack of strategic guidance from President Obama, according to a group of leading outside experts and
former officials.
&quot;Reform must take place,&quot; said dames Lalher, President &amp; CEO of the r!-olect on n; alone! Security Reform (PNSR), If
you did not like what happened in the last 7 or 8 years... you're not going to like what's coming in the future.&quot;
&quot;Momentum for reform is building, but it is largely rhetoric and good intentions,&quot; reads PNSR's .new report . The
congressionally funded group was begun as the result of a cooperative agreement between the Defense Department and
the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. &quot;Strategic management of the national security system remains absent
and is desperately needed to make it integrated, cohesive, and agile,&quot; the report continues.
Calling reform of the national security infrastructure &quot;the number one national security issue,&quot; Locher said that America's
ability to operate in international arenas the world over is &quot;crippled&quot; by the dysfunction within the system.
He called the White House's national security staff &quot;incredibly weak,&quot; preventing integration and coordination
that the National Security Council should be doing.
&quot;There's almost no strategic guidance from the president or the executive office of the president,&quot; Locher said,
adding, &quot;We have almost no knowledge management in the national security system.&quot;
There's also no effective means for delegating the president's authority, he added.
Locher spoke a an event rolling out the latest PNSR report at the New American Foundation; hosted by its foreign policy
chief and editor of V/gst1inc.Vgz? N.DtL:9 Steve Clemons.
Clemons noted that according to the Goldwater-Nichols act, President Obama was required to submit a national security
strategy by June 18, 150 days into his presidency, but he failed to do so.
The &quot;Guiding Coalition&quot; that oversaw the PNSR report included heavyweights such as former Lockheed Martin CEO

Dear Cheryl:
Jean-Louis and I had a lengthy conversation today covering a broad range of subjects relating to your interest in
supporting textile and apparel activity in Haiti. He has subsequently shared with me a number of specific
materials on the Haiti project, including an email of yours which highlights the objectives of the project and a
suggested timeline, as well as the business proposal made by Hansoll. When I digest these latter materials, I
will consider myself in a much better position to make responsive recommendations to you.
As I communicated to Jean-Louis, I am happy to be helpful to you and the State Department on this project. I
can make myself available a couple of days a month for meetings and pretty much on an as needed basis for
phone conversations. I retain my affiliation with Warburg Pincus, the global private equity firm. This requires
my presence in New York (generally) a couple of days a week. As I think you know, I am also Chairman of the
Board of Campbell Soup Company. This entails three or four days a month.
Fortunately, I am not really &quot;retired.&quot; This means that I have some flexibility in how I spend my time. You
should feel free to call on me.
I retain my interest in and connections with the retail and apparel industry. While I am far from an expert on
sourcing and production of apparel and textiles, I have some relevant experience and many friends who will do
their best to keep me from looking foolish.

Whenever you do something big on TV we all hear from lots of folks saying you did great. But this time is noticeably
different. First, people across the spectrum - DC insiders, reporters, staff, ex-staff, friends of friends, WH folks, etc -
were blown away. Second, people were REALLY moved by the last segment, three people even told me they teared up.
I'm guessing and hoping you hear this directly from random folks in the coming days.
And I think because it's been a lousy couple of weeks for the Admin, with mixed messages and bad news, coupled with
many people seeing you for the first time for an extended period talking about the job and your relationship with the
President, and that combo was probably the most powerful reminder since your speech in Denver that you're in a class
all your own (including the President who became enmeshed in the Gates incident)
That you didn't wait for the envoy question was key, you turned it into a strength. What you said about the President

Mexico will be held Nov 29-Dec 10. There is also a Dec 10 conf on trafficking in Luxor sponsored by Mrs. Mubarak that

Ben Cardin wants me to come give a speech about the 35th anniversary of the Helsinki Accords on the Hill so I thought If

US Responds To Sri Lanka Protest Over Clinton Remark (AFP) Monday, October 5, 2009 AFP
WASHINGTON (AFP) - The United States, responding to protests from Sri Lanka over remarks by Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton, said it had no recent evidence of women being raped while in Sri Lankan government custody.
In a letter addressed to Sri Lanka's Minister of Foreign Affairs Rohitha Bogollagama, the State Department noted that the
US government and international human rights groups over the years had detailed &quot;numerous cases of rape and sexual
violence in Sri Lanka, particularly acts committed against women held in detention by the government.&quot;
However, the letter signed by Melanne Verveer, ambassador at large for global women's issues at the State Department
said that &quot;in the most recent phase of the conflict, from 2006 to 2009 ... we have not received reports that rape and
sexual abuse were used as tools of war, as they clearly have in other conflict area around the world.&quot;
&quot;We hope that this clarification puts the issue in its proper context,&quot; the letter said, adding that Washington remains
concerned about extrajudicial killings, disappearances and detainee abuse in Sri Lanka.
&quot;Secretary Clinton believes that Sri Lanka must focus to the future and move forward on the promotion of peace and the
protection of human rights,&quot; the letter said.
Sri Lanka lodged its protest with the US embassy in Colombo over the remarks made by Clinton last month to the United
Nations Security Council.
&quot;We've seen rape used as a tactic of war before in Bosnia, Burma and Sri Lanka and elsewhere,&quot; the US secretary of state
had said during a resolution calling for an end to sexual violence in armed conflict, according to published reports of
Clinton's remarks.
Her comments sparked an outcry across Sri Lanka, where government forces in May crushed Tamil Tiger rebels after
decades of fighting.

I wanted to give you some brief observations from my trip to Lithuania. First of all, their friendship with the US and
respect for you was much in evidence on all levels. Most of the cabinet turned out for the reception that the amb hosted
for me. The FM went out his way to tell me what it meant to get a call from you when he assumed his position (he's
hoping to have a few mins with you in Tallin). As far as Lith has to go, it has achieved some remarkable achievements for
Eastern Eur. They have a female president, Speaker, Finance minister and def. minister. I had a good meeting with the
President and thanked her for Lith commitment to our collective efforts in afghanistan. They run the smallest PRT and,
despite a tough economy, have done everything we've asked in terms of additional support since the surge. The meeting
with the Speaker and top women members of the parl'nt was yet another reminder of your inspiration over many years.
One of the women was at the Vienna VV conf and said she's in politics today because of you. Another read about safe
birthing kits in your book and was inspired to send several thousand to Afghanistan. They are eager for more
opportunities to work together.
I came primarily to launch the new working group on gender that we and Lith are co-chairing. There was much gratitude
for our leadership with them in the Community of Democracies.
The meaning of democracy is so strong for people who had to stuggle for it more recently. They really feel this is an
important time to renew the understanding of democ, particularly after the bruising it underwent over the last several
years.
We had terrific turnout from other countries, many comments about you and references to Beijing and Iceland VV conf.
(So many people told me the impact Vienna and Iceland had on them). We left our meeting with many commitments for
future concrete projects that will be undertaken. There is great hope that you will be in Krakow in July for the CD
ministerial. The Lith CD coordinator headed to Belgium the next day for an EU meeting. He told me he got a very positive
response for our gender initiative and that Ashton was particularly excited about it. The EU is locating their new gender
institute in Lithuania and they are ager for our help.

negotiations with Israel if the renewed West Bank settlement construction is not halted. Those expected

    <body>First and most important: Do NOT, repeat, NOT, call any prospective winner on either Election
Night, May 6, or on the next day, Friday, May 7. The result will be unclear. It will not be clear,
even perhaps by Friday afternoon. Today, the combined polls show Cameron and the
Conservatives ahead but not winning an outright majority. The latest Guardian poll, out
tomorrow, shown me by Alan Rusbridger today, has the Tories falling short of a majority of
seats. Even if Cameron were to win an outright majority, Brown and Labour will attempt to
make a deal with Clegg and the Liberal Democrats. Brown remains as Prime Minister unless the
Tories win outright, which take a long time to determine. Labour and the Lib-Dems will almost
certainly gain about 60 percent of the vote, more or less. Brown will reach out to Clegg to stay in
power. The deal will be that Brown will approve a referendum on proportional representation
giving the LDs much greater representationin future elections. That will spell the end forever of
the Tories ever coming to power. The Tories see the election in apocalyptic terms—and they are
not wrong. Brown's weakness heralds the sort of grand progressive coalition/alliance that Tony
imagined but was never able to attempt between Labour and the LDs. Brown offering the
referendum would be the first step toward that. In the case of the Tories falling short of an
outright majority in seats, they will respond as though Brown is acting illegitimately, which he
would not be by remaining as PM and dealing with Clegg. Informed people are already talking
of what might begin to unfold on Friday as &quot;Florida.&quot; The Tories, backed by the Murdoch press,
will attempt to push Labour aside by force majeure—something that will not succeed under those
circumstances. The Murdochs are almost literally going crazy. James Murdoch and hiw wife

The Secretary's Call Sheet for
Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari
Purpose of Call: To express your condolences regarding the deaths of Iraqi MFA personnel in the August 19 attack on
the Iraqi Foreign Ministry.
III I want to personally express my heartfelt condolences to you for the savage attack on the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign
Affairs today and for the tragic loss of so many Iraqi lives around Baghdad and particularly at the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.
IE I remember fondly our meeting at the MFA in April — I was proud to be the first senior U.S. official to attend a meeting
there, and I was deeply saddened to hear that your Ministry was attacked.
11 This is a trying day for Iraqis and the Government of Iraq, but brutal attacks like these only deepen the need for
dedicated Iraqi like you and those in your Ministry, to remain committed to the new Iraq.
[13 Know that the United States will continue to stand by Iraq as it faces these challenges.
Background: On Wednesday, August 19, what appears to be a series of VBIED and additional rocket attacks in Baghdad
resulted in the bloodiest day in Baghdad since the June 30 withdrawal of U.S. forces from urban areas. Although exact
numbers have not been confirmed, media is reporting that approximately 75 people were killed across Baghdad with
over 100 injuries. The most devastating attack appears to have been against the Iraqi MFA, where a VBIED was
exploded in front of the main gate. Zebari's Chief of Staff estimated that there were 35-40 fatalities and up to 40
injuries resulting from this attack, with 70% of the building damaged. In April, you were the first senior U.S. official to
hold a meeting at the MFA. Deputy Foreign Minister Labid Abbawi, who attended your meeting at the MFA and who's

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
IRAQI NATIONAL ELECTIONS
I congratulate all the people of Iraq who participated in national elections today and over the past three days. There is
no better rebuke to the violent extremists who seek to derail Iraq's progress. Our thoughts and prayers are with the
families who lost friends and loved ones, and we salute the determination of the Iraqi people to reaffirm their
commitment to democracy and to charting their own future free of fear and intimidation.
Thanks to the efforts of the Iraq High Electoral Commission and the Iraqi Security Forces, which organized the voting and
ensured security at thousands of polling sites throughout the country, Iraqi men and women from all parts of the
country were able to go to the polls and choose their leaders freely.
I also would like to commend Ambassador Hill, General Odierno and all the U.S. civilian and military personnel who
supported this historic effort.

President Calderon's efforts, and the attention Mexico and the border is now getting, and had spoken yesterday with
Secretary Napolitano. He stressed that he thinks we should be doing more for Mexico (he mentioned only wanting to
get funding for Mexican improvements to ports of entry). I ran intc going in as I was

grateful for the US participation and the Secretary's leadership. We agreed to get together very soon to review &quot;action

Happy New Year. I hope you got some time to enjoy the holiday season and could relax before getting back at it this
year.
Andy Young is a very good friend of mine, and has been a stalwart for the Clintons over the years. He is also one of the
most recognized and respected experts on Africa in America. He asked me today if I thought it would be appropriate for
him to seek to see the Secretary to share some of his thoughts on Africa and current issues being confronted there. I
told him of course and suggested that he reach out to you to try to arrange that dialogue. Hopefully that is ok from your
perspective. Andy is a thoughtful, remarkable and decent man. If you don't know him you will enjoy getting to know
him. Thanks and maybe one of these days when I am in DC we can grab a coffee together. Cheers.

Thank you so much for your support for this project and for how quickly you made it move. Please convey our thanks to
the Secretary for her leadership on this issue. It has truly touched our members. As you may have seen, it received wide
attention within LGBT media, youth media (MTV and VH1), and the wider media. The video has over 110,000 views on
youtube already, and she is likely to touch many more people as it spreads.
Many thanks,
Jon

Subject: GLIFFA Gay Pride Event - Vandalism (proofed and revised)
Attached is the flyer for today's event to be held at noon in the Dean Acheson Auditorium.
Our staff observed to our dismay that during the night or early this morning, someone removed and discarded all of
the flyers for this event which we had placed in elevator wells throughout the building.
We consider this Anti - Gay vandalism, and though not entirely unexpected, it certainly cannot be tolerated.
My staff is in the process of reprinting and distributing the announcements, which are critical to ensure the broadest
possible publicity for attendance. Moreover it is very important that GLIFFA understand the Department of State
supports them as fully as we do all other Affinity Groups. Moreover, we will protect their rights to assembly, free
speech, and freedom from harassment.
We ask that you immediate help in monitoring the elevator wells and other spaces for the next two hours to deter
and discourage vandals. Please have your personnel approach anyone in the act of unauthorized poster removal, and
take any other measures you deem appropriate to deal with this situation.
Thank you for the advice you have already given and thanks in advance for the assistance and support you will render to
address this problem.

    <body>SECURITY COUNCIL PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT ON THE RECENT INCIDENT IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN
The Security Council deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries resulting from the use of force during the Israeli military
operation in international waters against the convoy sailing to Gaza. The Council, in this context, condemns those acts
which resulted in the loss of at least ten civilians and many wounded, and expresses its condolences to their
families. The Security Council requests the immediate release of the ships as well as the civilians held by Israel. The
Council urges Israel to permit full consular access, to allow the countries concerned to retrieve their deceased and
wounded immediately, and to ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance from the convoy to its destination. The
Security Council takes note of the statement of the UN Secretary—General on the need to have a full investigation into
the matter and it calls for a prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation conforming to international
standards. The Security Council stresses that the situation in Gaza is not sustainable. The Council re-emphasizes the
importance of the full implementation of Resolutions 1850 and 1860. In that context, it reiterates its grave concern at
the humanitarian situation in Gaza and stresses the need for sustained and regular flow of goods and people to Gaza as
well as unimpeded provision and distribution of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza. The Security Council

MCCAIN: I know that in my view, Secretary Clinton, when she said she assumed full responsibility, she
certainly has a lot of responsibility for what happened in Benghazi. That's -- that report made that very
clear. But I must say, I have never seen Secretary Clinton back down from a fight. And I have
never seen her back down. And / believe that she is now not physically well enough to testify

Subject: Passing of Dr. Peter Andrew Kraemer
The Office of the Historian is saddened to announce the premature passing of Dr. Peter Andrew Kraemer on
April 7, 2010
Dr. Kraemer joined the office in August 2004 as a historian producing volumes in the Foreign Relations of the
United States series, the official documentary history of U.S. foreign policy. He worked on volumes on South
Asia, Eastern Europe, and national security policy. He regularly lectured in the Foreign Service Institute's A-
100 orientation course for Foreign Service Officers. In November 2009, he made a video appearance on the
Department's DipNote blog, where he spoke about the rise and fall of the Berlin Wall. In January 2009, he
participated in an on-the-ground lessons learned project in Iraq, conducting oral history interviews on the nature
of civil-military cooperation.
In addition to his work at the Office of the Historian, Dr. Kraemer was a Professorial Lecturer in History at The
George Washington University, where he taught a course on the political, social, and cultural techniques that
create historical narratives. In years past, he taught History and American Studies at Indiana University and
Indiana University-Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin; served as an editorial assistant at the Journal of American
History; and worked as an oral historian at Indiana University's Oral History Research Center and the U.S.
Holocaust Memorial Museum. He was an active member of a number of professional organizations, including
the American Historian Association, the Organization of American Historians, the Society for Historians of
American Foreign Relations, and the Society for History in the Federal Government.
Dr. Kraemer completed his Ph.D. in History and American Studies at Indiana University in 2004, where he
wrote a dissertation entitled, &quot;Germany is Whose Problem?: American Philanthropy and the German Question,
1944-1964.&quot; He took his M.A. in History from Indiana University and his B.A. in History and German at
Dickinson College.

(SBU)
Benghazi Sitrep 017, April 22, 2011
Politicallecsmomic developments
Coda McCain: Senator McCain had an enthusiastic reception in Benghazi. The TNC welcomed his strong
statements of support, and US flag-waving Libyans cheered him wherever he went. The INC praised the
introduction of US Predator aircraft and asked that the US jam Libyan television broadcasting, The NC's
finance minister told him that his top ptiotities are to obtain a line of credit to meet basic needs, and to find a
way under the sanctions to allow trade with the liberated parts of Libya. He was impressed by the civilian
leadership but came away with serious doubts about the military's leadership, organization, and capabilities. He
was heartened to hear that the MC plans to shake up the military leadership and appoint a minister of defense--
equivalent as early as next week. In a press conference, he advocated the use of more effective US strike
aircraft in the NATO missions and US facilitation of 3&quot;I party arms transfers to the rebels; be stopped short of
endorsing the introduction of US military advisers, saying that role could be filled by others. He was clearly
moved by the plight of the people of Misrata and visited a hospital where he met a number of patients who were
severely wounded in the fighting there. The Human Rights Watch representative in Benghazi and a INC
member from Misrata briefed him on the situation there.
Consular issue: Conoff received the deceased Amcies personal effects from the IOM representative in Benghazi
and submitted them to the UK delegation in Benghazi in order to be flown out with the body. The Aincifs body
departed Libya on the evening of 22 April.
Injured Arncit will board a UNICEF-chartered ship that will depart Misurata at 2300 local time on B6
22 April and will arrive in Malta approximately 22 hours later.
A memorial service for the journalists was held at the Tibesti hotel, attended by INC deputy chairman Abd al-
Hafidh Goglia, the UK envoy, and the US envoy. Ghoga and the envoys also delivered remarks.

Subject: For the Secretary of State visit to Haiti
I enjoyed the opportunity to discuss the emerging potential that Haiti presents with the Secretary of State and
former President Clinton last night. I would like to take this opportunity to make a brief suggestion for Thursday's trip to
Haiti:
We discussed the catalytic role the United States could play in leveraging much needed private investment in
large scale job creation, for example through direct involvement of OPIC. In my report I pointed out that the port in Port-
au-Prince is the most expensive port in the Caribbean and recommended the opening of new private ports. Ports
remain a critical bottleneck to a job creation strategy both in garment manufacturing and agriculture. They also play a
pivotal role in ensuring that some of the complementary imports necessary for the proposed road construction projects
can enter the country both in the required quantities and in a cost-effective and timely manner. Elsewhere I have argued
that spiraling prices in construction booms often mean that available funds only go half way to the finishing line.
The Haitian authorities have already made inroads in addressing some of these inefficiencies and stand ready to
do more. In fact, Prime Minister Pierre-Louis noted in the letter to investors which was presented at the meeting with

December 10, 2010
WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Olympia). Snowe (R-Maine) released the following statement in support of Senate
ratification of the New START Treaty:
&quot;The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as New START, was signed by the United States and Russia on April
8th and transmitted for the advice and consent of the Senate on May 13th of this year. Since then, the U.S. Senate has

Kelly, Craig A; Webster, Christopher W;
I just received a call from Arias. He expressed his appreciation for everything the US had done in support of democracy
in Honduras. He said the recent tough messages by Insulza, OAS Ambassadors and USG officials. strengthened by US
sanctions, was having an impact on the M regime. He praised our decision to close the consulate and urged that we also
move to take away tourist and business visas from key regime members and supporters. I told him we were working on
implementing the visa and other measures which I expected could be announced soon.
Arias was critical of Z saying his recent public statements continued to be unhelpful. He described Z's statement
advocating the death penalty (presumably to apply to his political enemies) and asking for the extension of his term in
office as &quot;disastrous&quot;. He said that Insulza had made the right call by not allowing Z to address the OASGA. We agreed
the influence of FM Rodas over Z was highly negative,
I told Arias I would be back in Honduras tomorrow and planned in the coming days to press influential political, business

Will I receive a full notebook for approps hearings tonight?
Yes, and a draft of the testimony.
I'd like a call this afternoon or evening to go over the draft Af-Pak regional strategy. Who should be on call? It is quite
good but lacks &quot;milestones&quot; and budgets for each section.
Sounds good. Huma and I will work to set it up. The budget issue is complicated we've had several discussions about
it. It's hard to put down numbers with confidence.
Call should be with Jack, Piper, Rich, Paul Jones, and Sean Misko.
Re the required report for Kerry-Lugar, I want to be sure that the language in both our report and this one echo the
same language.
Paul, Sean, and Rich are going back over to make sure of that. Our chief method is to use framing language from the
strategy to frame the KLB report as well.

Richard Wolfe
Wolffe covered the entire length of Barack Obama's presidential campaign for Newsweek magazine, traveling
with the candidate and his inner circle from his announcement through election day, 21 months later.
As a political analyst on MS7VBC, he appears frequently on Countdown with Keith Olbermann and Hardball. On
NBC, he has featured as a political commentator on Meet The Press and TODAY. He features prominently in
the forthcoming HBO documentary on the Obama campaign, and played a leading role in the HBO
documentary of the 2000 Bush campaign, Journeys With George. He previously appeared on CNN and Fox
News, as well as international media including British, Canadian and Australian television.
He now writes regularly for The Daily Beast.
As Newsweek's senior White House correspondent, his cover stories included What He Believes (on Obama's
faith) Black &amp; White (about Obama and racial politics), Bush In The Bubble (after Hurricane Katrina) and
Weight of the World (how Bush handled the Lebanon war). Wolfe joined Newsweek in November 2002 as
diplomatic correspondent, covering foreign policy and international affairs. In the 2004 presidential election, he
covered the Howard Dean campaign before switching to John Kerry.
Before Newsweek, Wolfe was a senior journalist at the Financial Times, serving as its deputy bureau chief and
U.S. diplomatic correspondent in Washington. He reported on U.S. foreign policy, covered the Microsoft
antitrust trial, as well as regulatory and business issues at Treasury, the Federal Trade Commission and
Securities and Exchange Commission.
In April 2009, he joined Public Strategies, a business advisory firm, as Senior Strategist.
Wolfe is the co-author of The Victim's Fortune, (HarperCollins, 2002), about the deals that led to billions of
dollars in compensation to the Nazis' victims in the late 1990s. He also co-authored two Spanish cookbooks,
Tapas: A Taste of Spain in America (Clarkson Potter in the US and Planeta in Spain, 2005) and Made in Spain:
Spanish Dishes for the American Kitchen (Clarkson Potter, 2008). He has also written for food magazines such
as Food Arts and Food &amp; Wine. He authored an upcoming book on Obama's campaign called Renegade: The
Making of a President.
Born in in Birmingham, England, Wolffe is a 1992 graduate of Oxford University, first-class honors, in English

At the close of the 30 hours (or when they yield back) we are back on START. We were able to convince Reid this
morning not to file cloture on the treaty, which would have played in to Kyl's hands. So we are likely to have one full
more day of debate and some votes on amendments, then file cloture setting up a cloture vote early next week. Mccain

Dear Hillary,
I too am sorry not to be able to see you this time. I am currently making about one trip a month to DC for Symbion, so I
am sure there will be an opportunity in the near future. I hesitate to pester you personally so if there is somebody I can
work through to coordinate a time please let me know or have them drop me a note. My schedule is much more flexible
than yours.
By the way I just returned from Angola. Your stop there was a big hit. I found Luanda to be fascinating and much
different from much of Africa. I also found the women to be much more overtly powerful in their own right and not
exercising that power through their husbands. How refreshing. Valerie speaks to Women's Voices tonight and in.
prepping has been reading &quot;Half the Sky&quot; which reinforces everything you and Melanne have been fighting for for years.
When I gave my ambassadorial farewell address in Gabon in 1995 I made a point of saying that if I were the God of
development assistance I would do only one thing: give all the money to the women and then sit back and watch them
drive African economies forward. I hope you succeed in pushing the world in that direction. I don't know of a more
forceful and qualified advocate.

Bill Clinton to visit Haiti Monday as UN special envoy
07/02/2009 16:58
UNITED NATIONS, July 2, 2009 (AFP) - Former US president Bill Clinton will travel to Haiti Monday for his first visit as UN
special envoy to the Caribbean nation, the world body announced Thursday.
Clinton, who was appointed to the post by UN chief Ban Ki-moon last month, is to confer with government officials
&quot;about how to best support the efforts to prepare for hurricanes, generate new jobs and enhance the delivery of basic
social services,&quot; UN spokeswoman Michele Montas told reporters.
The former US president &quot;will also focus on how to ensure that the United Nations, civil society and the donor
community align their activities with the government's recovery plan as well as with each other,&quot; she added.
It will be Clinton's his second trip to Haiti this year.

    <body>Statement on the Death of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya
It is with profound sadness that I share the news of the death of four American personnel, in Benghazi, Libya yesterday.
Among them were United States Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and Foreign Service Information Management
Officer, Sean Smith. We are still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to all
their families and colleagues.
A 23. year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he sustained in the attack on
our office in Benghazi.
I had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spoke eloquently about his
passion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This assignment was only the latest in his more than two
decades of dedication to advancing closer ties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a
Peace Corps Volunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans on the ground
in Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to build the foundation for a new, free
nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work that he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's
values and interests, even when that meant putting himself in danger.
Sean was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten
years ago. Like Chris, Sean was one of our best. All the Americans
we lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this vicious and violent attack that took their
lives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan people reach for a better future.
America's diplomats and development experts stand on the front lines every day for our country. We are honored by
the service of each and every one of them.

Ma'am — Jake tells me that you are tired of the Lamplighter story. I'm sorry, I didn't know. But the Belfast people have
come up with a FANTASTIC story -- apparently, as per your request, they have tracked down the two kids who won the
peace essay contest in the 90s, and they are doing great things -- one is a teacher, one is a police officer. They are now
reaching out to get permission for you to tell their stories tomorrow night; assuming they will grant it, I am writing up
their stories now and will fax a revised draft to you shortly.
Sorry for the Lamplighter redux; I'll let Lissa know it's off-limits for at least a few years.

The link is here and its cut and pasted below. Simon Johnson is the Former Chief Economist of the IMF and now writes
for the NYT and for his own blog, hugely influential for bond traders, called Baseline Scenario. He also wrote the current
bestseller 13 bankers, making waves as probably the best academic indictment on the 2008 crisis (better in my view
than Michael Lewis' current book, which speaks more to the personalities involved).
And the US markets are taking a worse beating than even I would've thought possible. In the words of the owner of one

In a second case a Mexican employee and her husband were killed leaving the same party. Their 3 month-old baby was

Not much of a surprise. Later this morning KBH will announce that she will NOT resign her Senate seat.
You'll recall that she had had promised during her gubernatorial campaign that, win or lose, she'd give up her seat.

The Passing of Victoria DeLong
This morning I spoke with the family of Victoria DeLong, the Cultural Affairs Officer at our Embassy in Port-Au-Prince
who lost her life in the earthquake. I expressed my sincerest condolences on behalf of the men and women of the State
Department and the American people. This is one tragedy among so many. The United Nations has suffered grevious
losses. And the Hatian people have endured unimaginable heartbreak. For the State Department, we have lost one of
our own. Victoria was a veteran Foreign Service Officer who worked tirelessly to build bridges of understanding and
respect between the people of the United State and the people of Haiti. She served her country with distinction and
honor, and she will be sorely missed. Victoria's friends and colleagues at the Embassy are working day and night to

Still working this through, but here is where we are thus far:
The majority of all countries that have direct presidential elections use a Two-Round system. The number appears to be
at least 58.
France, most Latin American countries, all five post-Soviet Central Asian republics, and many countries in francophone
Africa use TRS to elect their presidents. Elsewhere in Africa the system is used by Angola, Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana,
Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Sao Tome and Principe, the Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Sudan,
Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe; in Europe, apart from France, it is used by Armenia, Azerbaijan, Austria, Belarus,
Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Finland, Georgia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia
and Ukraine; and it is found in Afghanistan, Haiti, Indonesia, Iran, Timor-Leste and Yemen.

Cheryl —
Well, I finally made it. Quite a start to be able to ride in with the President in AF1 and then roll into meetings with
Calderon and the leadership of the Mexican government. I will spend this week in Mexico. I will be back next week to
pack out, but will also follow up on a number of other issues while I am there.
I wanted to ask if you thought it might be possible to get a bit of time with the Secretary. There are two requests going
through the system. One is for a formal swearing in. I understand that she has one swearing in at 4:00 on Monday in
the Ben Franklin room, so one option would be if she could do the same for me in the Treaty Room at 4:30. I know this
is short notice — this has been one of those cases where planning has alluded us.
The second request is for a meeting with the Secretary. I would very much appreciate the chance to go over priorities

I imagine everything is quite crazy at the moment. I did not want to bother you today but would greatly appreciate it if
you would please pass along my good wishes to HRC for a fast and good recovery. Hope she will be back on track
soon. I am of course happy to help out in any way I can.
Also wanted to give you an update on ECA. Following up on our conversation over the weekend and as per your
direction I have had a number of good conversations with the ECA team including Mara. Happy to report we are all on
the same page with the career folks fully endorsing the plan. Details as follows:
• Grantee has been sanctioned
• IG is conducting investigation of grantee
• No further grants will be awarded to grantee pending outcome of IG investigation; probable outcome will be
delisting of grantee
• Working with Pat Kennedy to develop plan for spot checks of all grantees and random student checks
using existing Department resources
The IG investigation started today and as you predicted more information came out in the first meeting which led Miller
to request a full investigation of the Youth Services Program which I agreed to.

The article is good, just way too short, so it became very matter of fact, didn't include a lot of the great stuff he saw that
day. They cut what he turned in in half.
But for this readership, that length is probably perfect. It supposedly gets seen by 70 million people. 69 million
probably never open it up and just see it in their Sunday paper, so the cover is the ballgame. Story is basically an excuse
for the cover. And the cover is a homerun.
In the end, I firmly believe it will be the totality all these in-depth projects like Vogue, National Geographic, Nightline,
Time - which I know are annoying - that are going to create a collage documenting your success, especially in terms of
style and work ethic, which I believe is what people are most interested when it comes to their perception and approval
of you.

Wilma,
Attached is background information on the legislation Senator Voinovich referenced in his call with Secretary Clinton
today.
As Senator Voinovich mentioned to the Secretary, both bills are personal priorities for him.
I am the point of contact for the Passport Card Travel Enhancement Act of 2009 (S. 321), and we would like to work with
you in an effort to address State's concerns with the legislation. Please let me know if you have questions or need
additional information regarding this bill.
Todd Johnston is the point of contact for the International Clean Energy Development Act of 2009 (S.840). He can be
reached at 202-224-3353.
Thanks,

    <subject>Fw: Notes for S on Landler Chat</subject>
    <body>Mark Landler spoke to Jose Villarreal (the Commissioner General), Elizabeth and me in the last two
days. Mark seems to be going down the same road with all three of us. At first he knew very little about the
actual Expo but now he seems focused on the Secretary's role in bringing the USA Pavilion back to life. We all
agreed that he seems to be writing a favorable story.
He specifically wanted to know about her role and whether her &quot;political&quot; background helped her get there (
as opposed to a more traditional foreign affairs &quot;career&quot; Secretary). We thought that her political side helped
her immediately recognize that she had a real problem with the Chinese that needed to be fixed
immediately. As a problem-solving politico, she immediately went to work to fix it.
He also wanted to know if she used the WJC/HRC rolodex to raise money. We said no and noted that all of the
money is being raised in the business community and not by individuals. She did not go to her political fund-
raising base. We did not mention it but it is interesting that many of the early big sponsors were NY based
companies like GE (1
—), Pepsi ( ), Corning, Cummins, Deloitte, NYSE, and Pfizer.
He asked if S made individual calls to CEO's and we noted (as recd by L), the only general &quot;asks&quot; were done on
conference calls or in large groups. We also noted that she never really &quot;asked&quot; for sponsorships, instead she
stressed the importance of getting a formidable USA presence at the Shanghai Expo that is so important to the
Chinese and will attract 70 million people. This could be the largest event in human history and will go from
May 1 to October 31, 2010.

Cheryl,
As of this hour of Thursday night there is no deal on an ironclad, substantive, political platform of national solidarity and
governance reform, in return for Abdullah's gracious concession which would obviate the constitutional and political
need for a problematic rd round.
Karl and I remain in close touch with the candidates as they continue their engagement. But short of a miracle, there
will be no such deal at least until Friday evening or Saturday morning, if then.
Hence, as we understand the exigencies of our Boss's travel sked, it appears to be time to pull the plug: we won't be
recommending before our Friday evening that she make a stop in Kabul on Saturday. The default remains: no Kabul
stop.
Nonetheless, Abdullah has now set Saturday as the date for his address to the nation, and Karzai clearly wants both for
him to concede, and to attract a visit of the Secretary. The best scenario would have been an announcement in the
presence of the Secretary, as a trusted witness to whom the parties would be more or less politically accountable. If we
get happy news by Saturday morning and the Boss can't come then, or perhaps a day or two later on route home from
the ME, then we'll likely be recommending that she again phone each of the two protagonists, followed by a positive
public statement.

Dear Cheryl,
Thank you for the call on Thursday and for your understanding about my need to take care of certain
responsibilities before I depart as SCSL Prosecutor.
The Taylor testimony is going well from our point of view. He is opening himself to a devastating CX by
telling unexpected and unnecessary lies about his activities in Liberia and the region. I have been using my
access to senior Liberian, Sierra Leone, and UN officials to obtain new evidence with which to confront
him. This is well in hand and I dont see a problem in leaving even if Taylor is still on the stand on September
7. The major reason to stay as Prosecutor until that date (aside from the requirement of a 30-day notice to the
UNSG) is the oral argument on the appeal of our last case in Freetown (involving historic gender violence
convictions) on September 2, 3, and 4.
However, from my conversations with Clint, I am concerned that there are several issues that are coming to
head at this time, and know that I will have to hit the ground very fast on September 8. Because my schedule is
light in the coming week and because I have some leave days to use, I have therefore planned a quick trip to DC
to be there from Wednesday noon through Saturday noon, August 26-29. I wont yet move into the office, but

Jake/Huma/Lona:
I've got to have Lona get invites out today - the list is 18 after speaking with the Secretary on theory we will have yield of
12 - 14.
Before I have Lona invite anyone, I want to phase invites so our highest priorities have chance to response first and need
to know how big is too big to work; I have targeted 12-14 outside guests - given an expectation of 6-8 government folks.

Additionally, on March 11, 2004, you voted for a Lautenberg amendment that would have struck a provision in the CR
raising the debt limit.
Increases to the debt limit were also debated and considered by the Senate on March 17, 2004 and September 27, 2007.

    <body>I'm usually the pessimist, but I'm not sure this is as dire as it seems in the moment from 10,000 miles away.
First, the world/media is fixated on the President's speech, the imagery from Riyadh dominates, there's no Honduras
footage of interest, which is key. Speech tomorrow will blanket coverage and extinguish the Cuba stuff, so we just need
to weather the night.
Second, Tom &amp; Dan did an on the record conf call not long ago and we think they did very well. Dan was especially
strong, and he's also speaking to people 1:1
Third, your statement was strong and the reporting will catch up with it, it's only been out 90 minutes.
Fourth, we are suffering from two significant tactical problems: 1) you are here and removed 2) our press corps was out
of position today and in flight, so the people we worked on all week and the ones likely to skew our way were replaced
by reporters not connected to us.
The two issues above will be rectified tomorrow in your two interviews - especially Greta who is malleable. We can use
that to make a strong case on the principle, and the simple fact Cuba wasn't in the OAS yesterday, and won't be
tomorrow. Everyday that passes reinforces that point. The time difference to East Coast will help us in moving
whatever is said in these interviews tomorrow.
Short term, we started the week showing we can engage with Cuba (mail, migration), and ending it showing we are
serious about our redlines
Long term, we stood up for human rights and that can only be a plus.

February 2,2010 10:43 AM EST
Pennsylvania Rep. John Murtha was back in the hospital Tuesday after undergoing gall bladder
surgery last week.
The Virginia Hospital Center in Arlington said that the 77-year-old Democrat was a patient in its
intensive care unit but referred all questions about his condition to his family.
Murtha's congressional office confirmed that he underwent scheduled laparoscopic surgery to remove
his gallbladder at Bethesda Naval Hospital last week. But the congressman's spokesman refused
comment on the seriousness of his condition or any complication that required hospitalization.

Cheryl,
As discussed, please see the attached draft cable for the Secretary's approval. The draft letter text is pasted
below. WHA would like the Secretary to send a letter to all the UNASUR (Union of South American Nations)
foreign ministers regarding support for the U.S.-Colombia Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA). UNASUR is
having its summit meeting on August 28 and WHA would like the letter sent as soon as possible so that it can
be read and processed before the summit. Please note that Steinberg himself has NOT signed off on this
letter (his staff has), but we are expecting to hear from him this morning. Please tell me if you think this
should be held till he weighs in.

Still working this through, but here is where we are thus far:
The majority of all countries that have direct presidential elections use a Two-Round system. The number appears to be
at least 58.
France, most Latin American countries, all five post-Soviet Central Asian republics, and many countries in francophone
Africa use TRS to elect their presidents. Elsewhere in Africa the system is used by Angola, Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana,
Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Sao Tome and Principe, the Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Sudan,
Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe; in Europe, apart from France, it is used by Armenia, Azerbaijan, Austria, Belarus,
Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Finland, Georgia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia
and Ukraine; and it is found in Afghanistan, Haiti, Indonesia, Iran, Timor-Leste and Yemen.

Subject: second conversation with Mr. Gore re detained Amcits in North Korea
I spoke with Mr. Gore a second time today; I called him this afternoon after we had seen some brief wire stories appear,
referencing the KCNA report below. Explaining that this was my personal view, I said I was encouraged that the term
&quot;espionage&quot; did not appear in the KCNA report. I also mentioned that we were not aware of recent cases where
previously detained Amcits in the DPRK were &quot;indicted&quot; and &quot;brought to trial.&quot; I said I wouldn't read too much into
terms such as &quot;illegal entry&quot; and &quot;suspected hostile acts&quot;; I was still convinced that the track we've been pursuing, i.e.
gaining consular access through the Swedish Amb. in Pyongyang, and contact via other diplomatic channels, offered
hope for a resolution.
Mr. Gore said he very much appreciated the call. He asked that we convey as much of this information as we could to
the family members. I told him we would do so through CA.

Dear Hillary,
I met with Zohra Rasekh on Friday. You may remember her. She'd met with you during your trips to Kabul as
Senator. She is an Afghan-American who has been working in Afghanistan over the last six years and is
currently the country's Director of Human Rights. She knows the leaders very well --- and I might add, verifies
what is known about the rampant corruption, etc.
Since you are going to the Hague and since there will be no women from Afghanistan, I asked Zohra to give me
her assessment. Her comments reinforce what I heard from several other Afghan women leaders who were in
DC over the last week. I hope this is useful.
Senate willing, hopefully I'll be able to get to work soon.
Safe travels,

As I mentioned I have drafted a policy brief paper which I would have liked to share with you.
I wasn't able to finalize it as
planned before my depature. Attached is a few urgent issues about women that could be raised

Bill Clinton to U.S. soccer team: &quot;You are amazing!&quot;
By Joe Conason
•
AP/Michael Sohn
Former President Bill Clinton at the World Cup group C soccer match between the United States and Algeria in Pretoria,
South Africa on Wednesday
Salon's Joe Conason is traveling with Bill Clinton in Africa this week and was with the former president at today's U.S.
World Cup soccer game in Pretoria. He filed this report:
Minutes after Landon Donovan scored the stunning extra-time goal that won a critical World Cup match against Algeria,
Bill Clinton and several of his aides and friends (including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry
McAuliffe) were escorted downstairs to the U.S. team's locker room. The American players roared with pride as the former
president (and honorary chairman of the committee bidding to bring the World Cup to the U.S. in 2018 or 2022) walked in.
After a round of embraces, handshakes and high fives, he spoke briefly about his joy in their victory: &quot;I'm proud of you
because you didn't let the frustration of all the shots that you almost made get you down. You are amazing!&quot;
Much posing for pictures ensued with the shirtless, whooping, chest-bumping players -- who couldn't quite seem to
believe they had done it.
The team then invited Clinton alone to join them in the inner locker room, where he could be glimpsed toasting them with
a beer amid much additional hollering. When he emerged 10 minutes or so later, he had a broad smile and a hoarse
voice.
As Clinton left for Johannesburg, where he will meet tomorrow with former President Nelson Mandela, one of the players

Re: Most importantly....
Thanks for your nice words. They mean a lot. I will always, always play for your team, officially or not!
Many more thoughts on sports diplomacy that I'm excited about. And yes, once a jock, now an aging jock!
On QDDR article, you'll see that a lot is missing (most notably a section on the Middle East, as well as China, Western
Hemisphere (we should probably mention ECPA), a good energy example per David Goldwyn, et. al). it may also be too
Pakistan heavy, though it is a great example of everything we are trying to do. My main goal was to try to ground the
many elements at play in a more coherent narrative with a theme and thread that carried through. Didn't have enough
time on the bottom third. Hopefully this version gives us something to work with, though.
And I really hope you get some semblance of time off this week. If only the world would, for once, cooperate.

You may remember that I called on you early in the Administration on the UN statement on sexual
orientation. You were tremendous as was the Secretary. This request is not in keeping with the regular
hierarchy, but I had to send it. The video the Secretary did is extraordinarily powerful. Can you let her know
that individual employees in the building appreciate what she has been doing on LGBT rights? I know GLIFFA
will do so, but it's kind of their job to advocate. But if you could just tell her in a minute how deeply her work
is touching us in the trenches, well, it's something I think she deserves to hear.

The Secretary's messages at the meeting were outstanding, from OHR's point of view. Inzko is elated - particular with her
firm support for 5+2 and for judicious use of Bonn Powers (BP). Other than from the U.S., and usually from the UK, there
has been, at most, strong reluctance in the Quint to support BP use -- even when there are direct challenges to Dayton

NAACP's Bond at the W.H.
By CAROL E. LEE
Tensions between the White House and the NAACP over President Obama.s upcoming address at the
groups 100th ...
....anniversary celebration were *not totally resolved after leaders of the influential civil rights
organization met with two senior White House aides Thursday morning.
*There.s some scheduling adjustments that have to be made,* Julian Bond told POLITICO as he left the
West Wing. But he.s coming..
Bond and Hilary Shelton, the NAACP.s vice president for advocacy, said they met with White House senior
adviser Valerie Jarrett and her chief of staff, Michael Strautmanis.
Bond said the NAACP and the White House have agreed on a date • July 16 but have yet to settle on a time
when Obama will address the groups conference. At issue is the venue.
Ideally Obama.s speech would be at a location that makes it easy for everyone to see him* Bond said. So
far the White House has rejected some suggestions including Yankee Stadium • citing security reasons, and
there is a dispute over exactly what time he will speak.
*It was a healthy, helpful conversation,. Shelton said of the meeting.
Shelton and Bond said they did not see Obama while they were in the West Wing for roughly 45 minutes.
Attorney General Eric Holder is scheduled to address the NAACP.s conference on July 13, they said, and
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is also trying to schedule in appearance. The conference is being held from
July 11 to 16.
Shelton noted that Obama has not missed an annual NAACP meeting since he was elected to the Senate in

Dear Cheryl,
I want you to know that last month a friend of mine convinced me to apply for a fellowship at Harvard/Institute of
Politics, and I did. A few days ago, I got a call from the Program Director who informed me that I was accepted. I am very
excited about it and think it will be a very good opportunity to share my experience with students who
are learning theories about democracy and development.
Cheryl, I am going to be bold and ask you if you would accept my invitation to come and speak to the students while I
am there. I am asked and encouraged to invite important personalities who can talk of their experience in government
and I thought of you. I would be thrilled if you accept. I will be there from end of January until the beginning of May next
year. I have also invited President Moreno of IDB who accepted and I am waiting for an answer from Michaelle Jean, the
General Governor of Canada.

The administration's response seems quite weak to me.
This is not like the Pentagon Papers or even the videos of the bombings, this is a wholesale capturing of the diplomatic
material of the country. No State department can operate if it can't keep its own classified cables and internal orders
confidential — Ithink this is unprecedented in history. And if this is wikileaks can get, what can the Chinese or other able
to secure?
The issues surrounding the content are significant and could have legs.

We have just received an action memo seeking a timely decision on State's position on a trade dispute with
Mexico. EEB and WHA have competing recommendations.
First, some background. Mexico requested a WTO panel to resolve its tuna/dolphin dispute with the United
States U.S. measures prohibit Mexican tuna from being labeled &quot;dolphin safe&quot; even though the tuna is
harvested in accordance with the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Program. However,
dolphin population recovery has not occurred as rapidly as expected under that Program. Despite the measures,
Mexico exported about $18 million worth of tuna to the United States in 2007.

Mike, I write to ask a personal favor. An old friend of mine named David Ramage died earlier this week
David was for many years the president of the New World Foundation. During that period the
Secretary served on the board of the foundation and worked with David. His family would like the Secretary to be
informed of David's death. Incidentally when I worked at the NSC I walked David over to the White House for a private
meeting with the First Lady which was just the two of them. I can provide additional details on the memorial service if
she were interested but the family's concern was only that she be informed. Mort

SECURITY COUNCIL PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT ON THE RECENT INCIDENT IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN
The Security Council deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries resulting from the use of force during the Israeli military
operation in international waters against the convoy sailing to Gaza. The Council, in this context, condemns those acts
which resulted in the loss of at least ten civilians and many wounded, and expresses its condolences to their
families. The Security Council requests the immediate release of the ships as well as the civilians held by Israel. The
Council urges Israel to permit full consular access, to allow the countries concerned to retrieve their deceased and
wounded immediately, and to ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance from the convoy to its destination. The
Security Council takes note of the statement of the UN Secretary—General on the need to have a full investigation into
the matter and it calls for a prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation conforminglo international
standards. The Security Council stresses that the situation in Gaza is not sustainable. The Council re-emphasizes the
importance of the full implementation of Resolutions 1850 and 1860. In that context, it reiterates its grave concern at
the humanitarian situation in Gaza and stresses the need for sustained and regular flow of goods and people to Gaza as
well as unimpeded provision and distribution of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza. The Security Council

Below is the statement for spox to release for after the flight goes wheels up. I will let you know when that happens. We anticipate
around 8:30pm. CA has reached out to HE1S who will be receiving the plane and they will help keep media away from the AmCits and
facilitate entry. Once they arrive in Miami it is up to them to get to their destination.
Thanks,

Today, the Haitian judge released eight of the ten American citizens and they have departed Haiti for the United
States. Two members of the group are being detained in Haiti to answer further questions, as the investigation is
ongoing. The United State Government respects the sovereign right of the Government of Haiti to conduct its
own judicial processes. The United States Embassy in Port au Prince has been providing the detained
Americans with consular visits and assistance to ensure that they are safe and receiving necessary care. Haitian
authorities have been cooperative in ensuring the individuals' safety and welfare since their arrest and we have
every expectation this will continue.

Rep. Diane Watson (D-Calif.) is set to announce her retirement, according to Democratic sources.
Watson's central Los Angeles district isn't expected to be competitive in the general election, as it
carries a distinct Democratic advantage as a majority-minority district. President Barack Obama

notification. So NEA, F, and H all signed out the plan for congressional notification. While the plan took all summer to
develop, obviously it shouldn't have gone forth on automatic pilot after Meghrahi.

Subject: Kabul update 23:00 local / 16:30 EDT
Cheryl,
As of this hour of Thursday night there is no deal on an ironclad, substantive, political platform of national solidarity and
governance reform, in return for Abdullah's gracious concession which would obviate the constitutional and political
need for a problematic 2nd round.
Karl and I remain in close touch with the candidates as they continue their engagement. But short of a miracle, there
will be no such deal at least until Friday evening or Saturday morning, if then.
Hence, as we understand the exigencies of our Boss's travel sked, it appears to be time to pull the plug: we won't be
recommending before our Friday evening that she make a stop in Kabul on Saturday. The default remains: no Kabul
stop.
Nonetheless, Abdullah has now set Saturday as the date for his address to the nation, and Karzai clearly wants both for
him to concede, and to attract a visit of the Secretary. The best scenario would have been an announcement in the
presence of the Secretary, as a trusted witness to whom the parties would be more or less politically accountable. If we
get happy news by Saturday morning and the Boss can't come then, or perhaps a day or two later on route home from
the ME, then we'll likely be recommending that she again phone each of the two protagonists, followed by a positive
public statement.

Clinton edges Palin for most admired
By: Andy Barr
December 30, 2009 08:48 AM EST
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is the most admired woman in America, barely edging
out former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, according to a Gallup poll out Wednesday.
When Gallup asked 1,025 adults nationwide to name the woman they admire most, 16
percent picked Clinton. Palin was the only other woman to be mentioned by at least 10
percent, being selected by 15 percent of those surveyed.
Daytime talk show host Oprah Winfrey came in third with 8 percent, edging out first lady
Michelle Obama who got 7 percent.
Rounding out the top 10 were former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Queen
Elizabeth II, who both received 2 percent, along with former British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, poet Maya Angelou, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Elin
Nordegren Woods, wife of golfer Tiger Woods — all of whom received 1 percent.
Clinton has been named most admired woman by the poll 14 times, going back to her time
as first lady. Only then-first lady Laura Bush in 2001 and Mother Teresa in 1995 and 1996
have been able to knock Clinton from her perch, though Palin came close.
President Barack Obama ran away with the competition for most admired man, receiving
the endorsement of 30 percent of those polled.
Former President George W. Bush came in second with 4 percent, topping former South
African President Nelson Mandela's 3 percent.
Fox News host Glenn Beck, Pope Benedict XVI, the Rev. Billy Graham and Microsoft
founder Bill Gates all received 2 percent. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), former President
George H.W. Bush, former President Bill Clinton and Tiger Woods received support from
1 percent of those polled. Clinton and Woods tied for 10th place.

Ma'am — Jake tells me that you are tired of the Lamplighter story. I'm sorry, I didn't know. But the Belfast people have
come up with a FANTASTIC story -- apparently, as per your request, they have tracked down the two kids who won the
peace essay contest in the 90s, and they are doing great things -- one is a teacher, one is a police officer. They are now
reaching out to get permission for you to tell their stories tomorrow night; assuming they will grant it, I am writing up
their stories now and will fax a revised draft to you shortly.
Sorry for the Lamplighter redux; I'll let Lissa know it's off-limits for at least a few years.

David Petraeus will testify on Benghazi
By KATIE GLUECK I 11/14/12 9:32 AM EST Updated: 11/14/12 9:54 AM EST
Gen. David Petraeus will testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein told POLITICO
Wednesday morning. But the exact schedule has not been set for his testimony.
&quot;Mr. Petraeus has indicated his willingness [to testify]. He is eager to come before the committee so we will work out the details,&quot; Feinstein said.
Earlier Wednesday, Fox New reported that the former director of the CIA who resigned last week over an extramarital affair, will still testify voluntarily on Friday
before congressional intelligence committees regarding the Sept, 11 attack on the U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya.
Petraeus was initially slated to offer testimony on Benghazi at closed hearings before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday.
Feinstein, the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on CNN's &quot;The Situation Room&quot; on Tuesday that she believed Petraeus would eventually
appear before the committee because he is a ''responsible person.&quot;

Biehi called a little after 1:30 pm to say the meeting with the de facto envoys had been abruptly cancelled -- but
for perhaps a positive reason.
Micheletti has asked about half the team to return to Tegucigalpa (Corrales stayed, as &quot;he seeks to confirm that
he will not lose his visa&quot;). In the phone call he got from the de facto envoys as they headed for the airport,
Biehl said he detected a positive attitude. The envoys seemed confident they would get M to sign the SJ
Accord. The envoys prmoised to call Biehi late this afternoon with the news from Honduras. If, if, if, if, the
news is positive, Biehl and OAS Political Director Victor Rico will leave for Tegucigalpa tomorrow morning to
meet Micheletti, make sure this is not another time-wasting tactic, and get something in writing from him that
he agrees to the Accord and will sign it.
Just before speaking to me, Biehl had spoken with Arias who expressed cautious optimisim that we might have
a break-through. Arias told Biehl to tell us, that if that happens the United States gets the credit.
Arias said the US has played the game exactly right, with the appropriate mix of carrots, sticks, toughness,
unified message, even-handedness and, above all, good timing. Arias said the Europeans have been calling him
over the past two days, and have fallen into line with the US; the Swedes, as head of the EU, and have told him
that they will take their cue from the US and will support US actions. Arias, Biehi said, was extremely
complimentary of the &quot;great political instincts shown by Secretary Clinton.&quot;

Blogging on the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling is more of what we love about the web. It's the kind of typical
collective dissection we have now come to expect but that never really existed before: serious, speculative, arcane, funny,
brilliant, baked, etc. The Sunliaht Foundation b!000inci is predictably good. Paul Blumenthal dips into the multinational
dimension of the new &quot;corporation as full citizen-person&quot; framework, drawing on blogging going on at Neytsweqk and the
CerAer for Pubiic inte'r'.
&quot;Looks like [the Court] might support allowing foreign companies to spend freely in elections in the United States. I guess
this would be the corporate globalization of the U.S. electoral system.&quot; So you gotta ask yourself: Who does Hugo Chavez
want for President?
Blumenthal excerpting the Center for Public Integrity:
The Center for Public Integrity looks at this closer and shows what kind of foreign influence we are
looking at:
One prominent examples is CITGO Petroleum Company — once the American-born
Cities Services Company, but purchased in 1990 by the Venezuelan government-owned
Petroieos de Venezuela S.A. The Citizens United ruling could conceivably allow
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who has sharply criticized both of the past two U.S.
presidents, to spend government funds to defeat an American political candidate, just by
having CITGO buy TV ads bashing his target.
And it's not just Chavez. The Saudi government owns Houston's Saudi Refining
Company and half of Motive Enterprises. Lenovo, which bought IBM's PC assets in 2004,
is partially owned by the Chinese government's Chinese Academy of Sciences. And
Singapore's APL Limited operates several U.S. port operations. A weakening of the limit
on corporate giving could mean China, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and any other country
that owns companies that operate in the U.S. could also have significant sway in
American electioneering.
I really can't see Americans being too happy about this.

Statement by the Director of Public Affairs for National Intelligence Shawn Turner on the intelligence
related to the terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya
In the aftermath of the terrorist attack on U.S. personnel and facilities in Benghazi, Libya, the Intelligence
Community launched a comprehensive effort to determine the circumstances surrounding the assault and to
identity the mpetrators. We also reviewed all available intelligence to determine if there might be follow-on
attacks against our people or facilities in Libya or elsewhere in the world.
As the Intelligence Community collects and analyzes more information related to the attack, our understanding
of the event continues to evolve. In the immediate aftermath. there was information that led us to assess that the
attack began spontaneously following protests earlier that day at our embassy in Cairo. We provided that initial
assessment to Executive Branch officials and members of Congress, who used that information to discuss the
attack publicly and provide updates as they became available. Throughout our investigation we continued to
emphasize that information gathered was preliminary and evolving.
As we learned more about the attack, we revised our initial assessment to reflect new information indicating that
it was a deliberate and organized terrorist attack carried out by extremists. It remains unclear if any group or
person exercised overall command and control of the attack, and if extremist group leaders directed their
members to participate. However, we do assess that some of those involved were linked to gmups affiliated
with or sympathetic to al-Qa`ida. We continue to make progress, but there remain many unanswered questions.
As more information becomes available our analysis will continue to evolve and we will obtain a more
complete understanding of the circumstances surrounding the terrorist attack.
We continue to support the ongoing FBI investigation and the State Department review of the Benghazi terrorist
attack, pmviding the full capabilities and resources of the Intelligence Community to those efforts. We also will
continue to meet our responsibility to keep Congress fully and currently informed. For its part, the Intelligence
Community will continue to follow the information about the tragic events in Benghazi wherever it leads. The
President demands and expects that we will do this, as do Congress and the American people. As an Intelligence
Community, we owe nothing less than our best efforts in this regard, especially to the families of the four
courageous Americans who lost their lives at Benghazi in service of their country

Meghann,
A couple of ideas.
1.To avoid a coordination nightmare, try to get a structure in which there is a single authority with some temporary
power - e.g. a senior Haiti figure (ex-PM would be ideal) + Bill Clinton, as co-CEOs, supported by a council where you can
put the key parties on so they dont feel excluded (e.g. EU which will otherwise sulk). It could start from the April Plan and
the US Plan.
2. To scale up basic service provision without doing a total bypass of the state, I suggest the Public Service Agencies
model that I have been working up for the OECD. Essentially, centralized funding of decentralized provision. Fortuitously,
this has just been endorsed by the Davos Global Agenda Council for Fragile States and will be pitched as one of the key
ideas at Davos. I attach the brief Davos write-up of the idea, and a fuller paper that I did recently for the OECD. Please

As we discussed during your salon dinner with Steve Clemons at Nora's, I am developing a practical strategy of
&quot;off-shore/on-shore balancing&quot; that would involve key USG agencies.
As the attached proposal explains, the new strategy is substantially different from previous historical constructs
in the literature on American grand strategy and offers important advantages to improve our position in
Afghanistan and other regions in the world in the coming years.
Going forward, I would like make sure I have State's views correct. If you and your staff could meet with me

I look forward to further discussion.

Re: Backdrop to your coming week
Below is a piece published today in The Observer, the Sunday newspaper of The Guardian, on the Chilcot
inquiry, summarizing the testimony so far and what is expected this week while you are drumming up support
for the Afghanistan initiative. Britain and Europe are riveted by Chilcot, especially official circles. The
objective correlative, of course, is trust in any 11.S. administration and deep skepticism about the Afghanistan
project. Yet another undercurrent among the mandarins is disdainful resentment of indifference to Britain, a
sentiment beyond Labour or the Tories but what has emerged as the view of the permanent establishment at
Whitehall and elsewhere.
Mandelson Watch: After Miliband declined to reach for the EU foreign secretaryship (though Sarkozy wanted
him to take it and Brown was not averse, even favorable), Mandelson personally campaigned on his own for it
among the Europeans. Mandelson was eager to Miliband to take the EU post, allowing Mandelson to be
appointed foreign minister. When Miliband refused, Mandelson's ambition was thwarted, and tried to seize the
EU position for himself, but without any backing in Europe or from Gordon. The Europeans thought him mad.

Politico:
Health care could soon go the way of the automobile, with users having no choice but to buy
insurance coverage.
Within four years, every American could be required to own health insurance or pay their way
through tax penalties. The odds of such a sea change rose last week when chief Democratic and
Republican Senate negotiators on a health care bill acknowledged that many on the Finance
Committee considered the so-called individual mandate essential to lower insurance costs for
those who already have coverage.
President Barack Obama didn't embrace the individual mandate during the campaign, which
means he would essentially start from scratch in terms of selling the idea to voters.
The mandate was a central policy difference with Hillary Clinton, who argued that a mandate

latest is that nato will make decision tomorrow morning, they don't want to cancel unless they have to and unless we
have other dates to offer. We talked about around poland in July for the alternative.

The Republican governor, who is viewed as a likely presidential candidate in 2012, commented on the Quran
controversy today at an airport news conference before leaving on an Asian trade mission. Pawlenty said that
people have a legal right to burn books, but that doesn't mean it's wise. He stopped short of saying the
burning shouldn't go forward.&quot;

ICC Prosecutor receives Palestinian Minister of Justice, Arab League and Independent Fact-
Finding Committee
ICC-OTP-20091016-PR465
On 16 October, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Luis Moreno-Ocampo, received a
Palestinian delegation headed by Dr. Ali Khashan, Minister of Justice of the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA). Dr. Khashan was accompanied by the Palestinian Ambassador to the Netherlands, Nabil Abuznaid, and
a team of legal experts including Vaughan Lowe QC, Professor of International Law at Oxford University. The
Prosecutor also received members of the Independent Fact-finding Committee led by Professor John Dugard
and members of the Arab League Secretariat, in the context of ongoing consultations.
The PNA delegation submitted a preliminary report presenting its legal arguments in support of the declaration
lodged on 22 January 2009, accepting the jurisdiction of the Court over crimes committed in Palestine. The Office
will carefully examine all supporting arguments submitted, starting with the initial issue of whether the declaration
by the PNA accepting the exercise of jurisdiction by the ICC meets statutory requirements. The Prosecutor said

A year later, Hillary wins
A year ago today, the final set of primaries made official the foregone conclusion that Barack Obama had won
the primary, and Hillary Clinton lost it.
There's far too much going on today to dwell on an anniversary, but it does seem worth noting one particular
piece of news in its light: On the central health care policy debate of the Democratic Primary -- which was, to
be fair, conducted within a fairly narrow frame -- Obama appears to have conceded today to a Senate plan likely
to more closely resemble Clinton's.
In a dense, careful letter to Ted Kennedy and Max Baucus, Obama offered his principles for a health care plan
and conceded on a central point: He is now open to an individual mandate, which he campaigned against, and
which is now being talked about by Senators of both parties with the buzzword &quot;shared responsibility.&quot;
Obama still backs a &quot;hardship waiver&quot; for people unable to afford the mandate -- which is consistent with the
core of his objection to the mandate. But what he cast as a principled difference of approach -- was the problem
merely that people couldn't afford insurance? or something more? -- seems to have been conceded.
Here's the relevant paragraph:
I understand the Committees are moving towards a principle of shared responsibility -- making
every American responsible for having health insurance coverage, and asking that employers
share in the cost. I share the goal of ending lapses and gaps in coverage that make us less healthy
and drive up everyone's costs, and I am open to your ideas on shared responsibility. But I believe
if we are going to make people responsible for owning health insurance, we must make health
care affordable. If we do end up with a system where people are responsible for their own
insurance, we need to provide a hardship waiver to exempt Americans who cannot afford it. In

Release of Sarah Shourd
I welcome Sarah Shourd's release from detention in Iran, and am pleased that she will soon be reunited with her
family. I appreciate the efforts of all those who have worked for her release, in particular the Swiss Protecting Power in
Tehran, the Omani Government, and the many other world leaders who have raised this case and the cases of other
detained or missing American citizens. Sarah's fiancé Shane Bauer, Joshua Fattal, and other U.S. citizens remain detained
or missing in Iran. We urge Iranian authorities to extend the same consideration to them by resolving their cases
without delay and allowing them to immediately return to their families.

Release of Aung San Suu Kyl
Today I join with billions of people around the world to welcome the long-overdue release of Burmese democracy leader
and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest.
Aung San Suu Kyi has endured enormous personal sacrifice in her peaceful struggle to bring democracy and human
rights to Burma, including unjustified detention for most of the past twenty years. The Burmese regime has repeatedly
rejected her offers to engage in dialogue and work together, trying instead to silence and isolate her. Through it all,
Aung San Suu Kyi's commitment to the Burmese people has not wavered.
The United States calls on Burma's leaders to ensure that Aung San Suu Kyi's release is unconditional so that she may

    <body>Ambassador for life
Career Foreign Service ambassadors almost never serve much longer than their traditional three-year terms
overseas. There have been a few exceptions, most famously former ambassador to Israel Sam Lewis, who was in
Tel Aviv for eight years until 1985. But the rule generally applies.
This summer, however, Ambassador to Kenya Michael E. Ranneberger, a veteran Africa hand, apparently will
begin his fifth year on the job in Nairobi, and there's no nominee in sight to replace him.
That sparked speculation that the administration might want to extend Ranneberger in order to hold the job open
for Sudan special envoy J. Scott Gration, should Gration work out the Sudan mess. Gration, Loop Fans recall,

I would be careful with the commercial farming. Many African leaders support it because it's good for their cronies.
Paul Collier has been one of the most vocal supporters of commercial farming - mostly because of the success of Brazil.
Our USAID colleagues are much less supportive because historically it doesn't have as much benefit for the poor as
working directly with rural farmers. I think the best way to frame this issue is to say: we support small holder farmers
and that's what our programs will emphasize; but, if we see an opportunity for commercial farms to also help achieve
our goal of lifting 100 million out of hunger and poverty, then we will support it. In general, commercial farms usually
benefit those who are above the poverty line - not those below it. Best, Matt

    <body>Madam Secretary,
In advance of your meeting tomorrow with George Soros, below is some information in response to the letter you
received from Soros proposing increased USG support for the American University of Central Asia (AUCA). SCA favors
providing more USG support for AUCA
Since 9/11 the United States has provided more than $15 million to AUCA in support of its endowment and various
other initiatives. For a majority of these contributions the Soros Foundation matched one dollar for every two dollars
provided by the USG. The major USG contributions to AUCA were two grants to the university endowment, the first in
2003 for $10 million, the second in 2008 for $3 million. Other USG support for AUCA included funding for two advisors to
the AUCA president on accreditation and development, support for the journalism faculty, and scholarship funds for
students from Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Afghanistan to attend the university.
Soros has proposed that the USG increase this support, offering a 1-1 match of $10 million each from State and his
foundation, totaling $20 million over the next five years. Last fall SCA received the same proposal from Soros, and they
have been discussing the issue with Soros' staff.
A little bit of additional information from SCA on AUCA: The university has made significant progress this year on a
number of its key objectives and remains a unique institution in Central Asia, a place where students are judged solely
on merit and a forum for free expression and critical thinking. The university achieved an important milestone this year
related to its U.S. accreditation, signing an agreement with Bard College under which AUCA graduates starting next May
will receive full diplomas from Bard College, an institution accredited in the United States. In addition, AUCA recently
established a new partnership with the American University in Kabul facilitated through state of the art video classroom
technology and recently announced the appointment of Andrew Wachtel, from Northwestern University, as the new
AUCA president who will take office this summer.
I will include this note (in addition to Soros' letter) in your materials for your meeting with Soros tomorrow. Please let

Just reached Tom about it. Alerted him to the version as it came to me, including potential of its breaking. He seemed
a) aware of the basis for what I'd heard, b) to share my assessment/concern (though asked me to elaborate, which I did
vividly), and c) prepared to make sure that whatever ready to be is said publicly - and whatever happens diplomatically -
put the kibosh on the version as it came to me.
Incidentally, unbidden by me on both points-i.e., volunteering-he went out of his way to says upbeat things about you
and downbeat things about OMF. Said he wanted to discuss that with me in person. I said nothing of substance, except
always glad to talk.
Over and out, tho would appreciate you're confirming receipt, since I'm not cc'ing anyone on this.
Cha-cha-cha (even though you're not going to Argentina-and rightly so).

Nalbandian statement: &quot;The Turkish side is informed and we are confident that they realize that we exclude the
conditioning of the normalization of Turkish-Armenian relations on steps toward the settlement of the Karabakh
conflict. Trying to link these two processes could lead to the failure of both. A number of countries, including
those of the Minsk Group Co-Chairs, have the same position. They have said many times that the normalization
of relations between Turkey and Armenia must be without preconditions. With this mutual understanding, we
have started and conducted negotiations and come to agreements that are reflected in the initialed protocols. If
the Turkish leadership has problems with the signing of these documents, they should not try to solve them by
distorting the spirit, essence, and goals of the initialed documents. The signing and implementation of the
agreed documents is a process that is full of difficulties. Nevertheless, Armenia is ready to respect the
agreements and move forward If the current authorities in Turkey are not ready to accept the fact of the
genocide perpetrated in the Ottoman Empire, then they are at least obliged to show respect toward the
survivors of the Armenian genocide and their descendants.&quot;

Quick note to tell you the meeting ended today after lunch and it turned out to be a very positive event. To a person, the
heads of delegation were hugely complimentary. Good, very candid — even &quot;frank&quot; as the diplomats say -- level of
engagement, a lot of positive feeling and trust built up, an eagerness for this group to continue engaging and — perhaps —
make some progress. Dan Reifsnyder, an OES DAS who's been here a long time, said it was best meeting of this kind he
has seen in 20 years.
Issues still damnably difficult, but a pretty palpable sense in the room that something good had happened. Hearty
congrats from the Chinese, UK, Japanese, Aussies, EU, Danes, Swedes, South Africans, etc. Mike Froman did an
excellent job as Chair (I was head of U.S. delegation), and Steve Chu and John Holdren did very useful presentations

Hope you're both well. The DVD screener should arrive at Huma's sometime this morning.
I can't wait for to hear what you think of the film and, if you have the time, how we can strengthen themes and sections
to make it a more relevant and effective educational and policy influencing tool. We are currently at various stages of
reaching out or building partnerships with a wide variety of organizations from Facing History and Ourselves to JStreet to
the Marine Corps to the United Nations
(informally) to various think tanks, and human rights organizations.
We have big plans for the film and hope to use it as a platform to foster critical cross-cultural conversations.
And a disclaimer- the film is still a work in progress. We are drastically changing the intro, moving some sections around,
and adding a story about the Marines sending senior Marine Officers to Jordan to negotiate and build partnerships with
Al Anbar's exiled tribal leaders.
I am so excited for you to see it.
Have a safe trip, I hope to see you soon, and all the best,

statements by the US official regarding the management of the Argentine economy. Controversy arose over statement
by Valenzuela during a restricted meeting with the local press in which he echoes the concerns of American
businessmen in that country regarding &quot;judicial insecurity&quot; and the management of the economy. Valenzuela, also
indicated that has been noted &quot;change&quot; in the investment climate for US businesses and reminded those present that

Subject: State Debt Problems Mount
Hi Jake,
This does not have a direct foreign policy bearing, but I think S would be interested — because it is an enormous and
growing problem. These stats come from a NYT Op-Ed piece:
• Over 20% of California's debt issuance during 2009 and over 30% of its debt issuance in 2010 to date has been
subsidized by the federal government in a program known as Build America Bonds. Under the program, the U.S.
Treasury covers 35% of the interest paid by the bonds. Arguably, without this program the interest cost of bonds
for some states would have reached prohibitive levels.
• &quot;California is not alone: Over 30% of Illinois's debt and over 40% of Nevada's debt issued since 2009 has also
been subsidized with these bonds. These states might have already reached some type of tipping point had the
federal program not been in place.&quot;

Subject: (Sydney Morning Herald) Abbas ready for direct talks with Israel
Palestinian President Abbas said he was ready for direct negotiations with Israel, following Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's accusations that the Palestinians are avoiding the talks. &quot;We are ready to hold direct peace negotiations
with Israel,&quot; Abbas told reporters after talks with Jordan's King Abdullah II in Amman. &quot;We have negotiated with Israeli
governments before, more than once. Why would we avoid such talks? We are not.&quot;
Netanyahu told the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs and defense earlier July 26 the Palestinians were trying
to sneak out of direct negotiations while Israel was ready to start them &quot;immediately.&quot; &quot;We have an understanding with
the Americans that we need to move now, without any delay, to direct negotiations, but in response, we have a clear
Palestinian attempt to avoid this process,&quot; Netanyahu said. &quot;They are trying to stall and to sneak away from direct
negotiations and to cause the Arab League to shackle the talks.&quot;

Subject: RE: READ BELOW RE: DONOR COORDINATION AND A HRA
Thanks Cheryl
I am now at my desk. I agree with concerns below. The cementing of the monopoly by Preval for the public container
port is a prime example how elite capture runs directly counter to job creation and social welfare.
Assets (land, heavy equipment, cement, petroleum) that are in high demand during a construction boom are in the
hands of a few. The risk is that price spikes will severely drive out the potential gains from aid dollars. Dual signatures
and injecting foreign experts into a HRA task force to review projects for eligibility will counteract obvious forms of
corruption.
The much harder task is to determine realistic benchmarks for project costs, given transfer pricing and de facto
cartels. Injecting competition and open bidding is needed to counteract this. The problem is that any Haitian firm will
loose business to US or Chinese contractors with much more favorable pricing structures (but limited spillovers to local
economy). A middle ground may be to invite joint ventures between Haitian and international companies to build up the
local workforce and overall skill base.

Enforced transparency will countermand it.
I thought Collier's earlier idea of an Independent Service Authority was interesting as long as it was

I like your idea. At this point a reconstruction authority with Bellerive at its head makes sense. I like
your idea of a donor's coordination mechanism that I saw in your policy review powerpoint, with
coordination on 'our' side under the UN Special Envoy mechanism.
Maybe within the authority, there can be a private sector sub-group coordinated and monitored by the
larger authority? This sub-group might also include non-Haitians, including Dominicans.

Please very hold dose but a few tidbits from meeting one on one with Jeff:
—Sahel/ Mali- will call for Envoy but not yet have named.
Mandate for envoy will be 1) put meat on strategy bones
to include political, security, development, humanitarian, human rights 2) make sure UN is implementing throughout all
agencies 3 mediation in Mali.
--Syria - LB believes key is putting together transitional government;
Grateful for conversation with Robert LB doesn't plan on coming to DC but prefers to see S in NY. Jeff believes
being based in Cairo is right thing for LB. Believes Morsi sincere in initiative but neither Jeff nor LB believe going
anywhere. LB very concerned about ideas coming from Saudis and does not yet have date to go to Riyadh. Concerned
about Bandar.
--Libya- Absolutely agrees that Mitri should turn attention to security. Sent to Beirut over weekend to see
Mitri and put security at top of agenda. Says we will like Mitri a lot. Also suggests when S sees Mikati that she say we will
watch closely how they conduct themselves as chair of Foreign Affairs committee of AL. Jeff had been worried about
Iranian initiative that Bill's call had killed.

today, mounted a counterattack, urging M not to leave. We are pushing back as we speak, and our de facto sources
who support the deal are working to nail it down.
We are making the point that M's agreement to us to step aside fueled our successful efforts over last couple days to
keep Euros and many Latins in the game but they need a change on the ground to support elections. M cannot pull
rug out now. Moreover, we said since the de factos claim moral authority (over Zelaya) for carrying out the Oct 30

Subject: (Reuters) Copenhagen accord was a &quot;disaster&quot;, says Sweden
BRUSSELS - Despite months of preparation and strenuous international diplomacy, the talks boiled down to an inability
of the world's two largest emitters, the United States and China, to agree on headline fixed targets.
The 27 member states of the EU had gone into the talks with a unified position and with a plan for financing emissions
cuts in the developing world, with a commitment to spend around 7 billion euros ($10.01 billion) over the next three
years to aid poorer countries.
But those aims were largely sidelined as the talks failed to produce the breakthrough agreement many had hoped for.
&quot;Europe never lost its aim, never, never came to splits or different positions, but of course this was mainly about other
countries really (being) unwilling, and especially the United States and China,&quot; said Carlgren.
Britain on Monday blamed China and a handful of other countries of holding the world to ransom by blocking a legally
binding treaty at Copenhagen, stepping up a blame game that has gathered momentum since the talks ended.
Prime Minister Gordon Brown described the summit as &quot;at best flawed and at worst chaotic&quot; and demanded an urgent
reform of the process to try to reach a legal treaty when talks are expected to resume in Germany next June.
But Danish Climate Minister Connie Hedegaard, who quit as president of the Copenhagen talks midway through after
being criticised by African countries for favouring wealthier nations in negotiations, said it was no time to get depressed

China sees no chance of climate deal - source
Thu Dec 17, 2009
Print I Single Page
By Krittivas Mukherjee and Pete Harrison
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - China has told participants in the U.N. climate change talks that it sees no possibility of
achieving an operational accord this week, an official involved in the Copenhagen talks said on Thursday.
Dozens of heads of state are descending on the Danish capital to address the December 7-18 conference, and had hoped
to sign on Friday a new pact to tackle global warming.
The official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters the Chinese had instead suggested issuing &quot;a short political
declaration of some sort,&quot; but it was not clear what that would say.
The official said negotiations were continuing to try to reach a breakthrough that would still allow an operational
agreement to be signed. The official said the sticking point for China appeared to be a process issue.
U.S. President Barack Obama has called for an &quot;operational accord&quot; -- essentially a political agreement with teeth that
can get countries working to cut or curb their greenhouse gas emissions while a more formal and binding treaty is
hammered out in 2010.
Some ministers warned that slow, often stalled talks during the summit meant it was staring at failure.
&quot;We may not get there on the substance, it is quite possible we'll fail on the substance, but at least let's give it a try,&quot;
said Britain's energy and climate minister Ed Miliband.
&quot;At the moment the problem is we're not giving it a try.&quot;
Developed and developing nations are at odds over who should cut emissions, how deep the cuts should be, and how
much funding should be provided to poor countries to help them shift to greener growth and adapt to a warmer world.
While the overall picture is bleak, there has been some progress in areas critical to reaching a deal.
Africa dramatically scaled back its expectations for climate aid from rich nations, and Japan pledged about $11 billion
(6.8 billion pound) in public funds to 2012 to help poor countries adapt to a warmer world and cut their emissions.
Talks on a U.N.-backed system to pay poorer nations to curb deforestation have advanced, and the United States
pledged $1 billion in short-term funds to conserve tropical forests.

Sen. Ron Wyden Has Early Stage Prostate Cancer, Will Miss Votes
Posted Thursday, December 16, 2010 5:06 PM I By David Weigel
Here is the statement -- Wyden caught the cancer early, but will have to miss votes tomorrow and
next week.
After my annual physical in late November, I was diagnosed with early stage prostate cancer. After reviewing all
the options with multiple physicians, I decided to take a proactive approach and have surgery, which will be
performed December 20 at Johns Hopkins Hospital by Dr. Alan Partin.
Thanks to routine screening, this was diagnosed very early and I expect a full and speedy recovery.
I scheduled the surgery for the Monday before Christmas anticipating that the Senate would have recessed by
that time and that there would be no disruption to my work in Oregon or Washington. However, it now appears
that I will be missing votes tomorrow and possibly next week while I prepare and undergo this procedure. I
expect to be back to work full-time when the Senate reconvenes in January.

    <body>Update from Rep. Stevens in Benghazi, based on largely on info from acting PM Ali Tarhouni and acting FM
Salah Bishari:
• TNC caretaker cabinet/members were up until 4am following events in Tripoli and discussing plans for
the coming days. Tarhouni said the TNC has been in constant communication with its people in Tripoli,
including both fighters and those entrusted with implementing the stabilization plans. Rebels in Tripoli,
in coordination with the TNC, have begun to set up checkpoints inside the city and guard public
buildings.
• TNC chairman Abd al Jalil and PM Jibril made statements to the media last night, urging people to
refrain from revenge attacks and destruction of public buildings.
• There has so far been &quot;no bloodbath&quot; or serious looting.
• The capture of Sail al-Islam al-Qadhafi and Mohamed al-Qadhafi is significant The TNC, including
Abd al-Jalil himself, intervened with rebels surrounding Mohamed's house to ensure that they did not
harm him. They understood that it would be harmful to the revolution and the TNC if he were
killed. These events were captured live by Al Jazeera in interviews with Mohamed. Both brothers are
in rebel custody (at this time, it is unclear to us exactly who is holding them, however).
• Per Tarhouni, the next steps are: 1) find Muammar Qadhafi; 2) issue a statement announcing the end of
the Qadhafi regime and the start of the interim period under the INC (TNC staff have begun drafting
this statement already); 3) insure the delivery of essential services and commodities (esp addressing the
acute shortages of fuel, children's milk, and medication for blood pressure and diabetes); and 4) move
the TNC to Tripoli.
• Regarding the move to Tripoli, Tarhouni said security arrangements would need to be made before they
could send the TNC.' leadership to the capital. We have heard from another contact that some TNC
members are already making plans to fly to Misurata and the Western Mountains, possibly as early as
today, and from there drive to Tripoli.
• Request for assistance: Tarhouni, who also holds US citizenship, said the items listed above (gas, diesel,
baby milk, and medicine) are urgently needed in Tripoli and recommended that the USG ship those
items directly to Zawiya's Port and publicize such assistance as soon as feasible (in coordination with
the INC). He said this would bring tlie US even more goodwill than it has already earned bore

Contrary to Smith's assertions, access to legal abortion will not be on the agenda of the MDG Summit this week in New

world leaders will focus on how to rid the world of extreme poverty and hunger and to make dramatic improvement to the

U.N. asks Afghanistan to lift election media ban
KABUL, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The United Nations has asked Afghanistan to lift a last-minute ban on media reporting of
violence during Thursday's presidential election, saying the Afghan constitution guaranteed a free press. Afghan
authorities imposed the ban on Tuesday with two decrees, the first barring journalists from reporting any violence in the
country between 6:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. (0130-1530 GMT) on polling day. The second ordered journalists to stay away
from the scenes of any attacks. The government says the measures are intended to prevent reports of violence from
scaring Afghans away from voting. Taliban fighters have vowed to disrupt the election. The United Nations said Afghans
had a right to information, and restricting the media could undermine confidence in the poll. &quot;People need access to
information, not only on polling day but after polling day. The credibility of these elections is directly linked to the
information that they have access to,&quot; said Aleem Siddique, spokesman for the U.N. mission in Kabul. &quot;Its unclear to us
what if any legal basis there would be for such a directive when Afghanistan's constitution guarantees freedom of
expression and freedom of the press. We are making this point to the Afghan authorities,&quot; he said on Wednesday.
Afghan police have taken a more aggressive attitude towards reporters in recent days. Several journalists were beaten
by police at the scene of a suicide car bombing on Tuesday and a siege with gunmen on Wednesday.

Subject: Quick readout from Jeff Feitman in Tried
Jeff asked me to pass along the following readout. Please excuse the free-form list of subjects but I wanted to get this
out quickly to as wide an audience as possible. Please feel free to share with others I've missed.
1. State of Embassy Tripoli facility: While admitting he is no engineer, Jeff agrees with the initial OBO assessment
that the facility is not salvageable — the condition is &quot;shocking and photos doesn't do it justice.' Floors have
collapsed, the ballistic glass and metal support beams have melted, and it has been totally trashed. Jeff asked
for their help on Embassy security; they took this on board but noted that they are still in the process of trying to
secure the country.
2. Abdel JAI and Mahmoud fibril both to NY next week: Both will travel to NY next week for the high level
meeting on the 20th. Jain will then return to Libya, and Jibril will remain in NY to deliver the Libyan address to
UNGA on the 24th. The plan is to have the new cabinet in place by the 2e,with Jibril the likely PM. Jeff pressed
them on including a woman on their UN delegation. He also made all of the points about the need for the INC
to take the lead in NY in outlining what they are seeking from the int'l community but they didn't share their
ideas about what they will say.
Action needed: Jalil needs a visa,
understand MAG is working this now but we will need to facilitate issuance (likely by Embassy Tunis).
1 Saadi Qadhafl and Niger: Jibril has sent a letter to Niamey and is sending the Deputy FM there to talk about
Saadi. The Libyan request to Niger will be two-fold: 1. Detain him properly (they understand he is free to roam
about 2. Be prepared to return him to Libya to stand trial.
4. Weapons issues: They will ask OPCW to come back and they want them to say yes but the Libyans are picking
up noises from OPCW that they can't accept a request from the INC now because the INC is not a UN
member. (comment: I know the credentials issue is being worked this week in NY but Ken Ward please convey
to OPCW that they need to take the Libyans up on their request asap.)
S. OUP mandate: they think NATO should stay beyond an additional 30 days (I told Jeff I thought we were now
looking at 90 in any case).
6. Pan Am 103: Jeff raised the issue with Jaill and the Justice Minister, which they took on board; Justice Minister
said &quot;this was a crime against humanity so Libya has to cooperate.&quot;
7. Treatment of Libyans of color and African migrants: Jeff raised and they responded with the right things.
8. Oil fund paper: Passed to INC.
9. &quot;Boots on the ground&quot;: they asked about the comments they had seen and expressed their concern over
them. Jeff explained that these were people to help provide security for our people and facility and why they
were necessary.

Jake, Cheryl,
Mike sent this note from Israel, and we will send to S as a note for the Secretary — wanted to give you an
advance copy. Will share with Jeff Feltman and Mara Rudman too.
Regards, Deborah G
NOTE from Mike Posner for the Secretary
Tomorrow, Nov. 11, we are completing a four day visit to Israel. I am accompanied by Colonel (Ret.) David
Graham, the Director of the Army Jag School in Charlottesville. This trip builds on our January visit in which
we met with various Israeli officials, including the Chief of Staff of the IDF, to discuss follow-up to the
Goldstone Report.
Our approach has been to offer our support and willingness to work with the Government of Israel to reframe
the public debate from defensive (responding to Goldstone or Flotilla reports and resolutions at the UN, etc.) to
a more pro-active narrative focused on the challenges of fighting an urban or asymmetrical war. We are
having productive, and generally positive preliminary conversations about a possible GOI white paper that
would: 1) set the context, outlining the challenges in fighting an asymmetrical conflict; 2) spell out the steps the
IDF and other agencies have taken to address these challenges; and 3) identify ongoing challenges that Israel
and other professional armies will need to address in the future.
We have been clear that this must be an Israeli initiative, not ours, but that we can help promote and use the
report once it has been completed. Thus far we have met with Deputy Foreign Minister Dan Ayalon, Minister
without Portfolio Benny Begin, Justice Minister Yaakov Neeman, and Deputy PM, Dan Meridor. Meridor, in
particular is very interested and supportive of what we are exploring. Tomorrow we will meet with Gabi
Ashkenazi, the IDF Chief of Staff, and with several other senior IDF officials, including General Avichai
Mandelblit, the IDF's Judge Advocate, who has led the the government's investigation of the Goldstone/Cast
Lead cases.
At this juncture we do not expect or need you to raise any of this with the PM or other Israeli officials. I simply
wanted you to know what we are doing, and the status of these efforts, in case anyone in the Israeli delegation
raises this with you.
End note
Deborah Graze

    <body>1. The draft, sent by separate email, is intended to give you options and ideas. Use as you
wish. Several ideas are at the core of this version: in particular, the concept of the US as a
modern global nation and how that serves our capacity for leadership.
2. For most policy speeches a generic tone and workmanlike prose are acceptable. But for
this one, it is not. This speech can't afford to be lackluster. It will then be held up in
invidious comparison to Obama's glittering best efforts. Your speech must have, amid the
policies, a distinctive and authoritative voice.
3. Your early draft makes no distinctions between allies or partners; indeed, it barely
mentions allies. The early draft also features a strong malaise theme. Even if rebutted
after being raised, the focus is on obstacles and hindrances, not on achievements,
opportunities and what can be achieved. There's no accounting of progress so far. The
effect is downbeat in tone. At the same time, the draft contains passages of vague and
gauzy liberal universalism, while in one line assailing it, an unconvincing juggling act.
The notion that all nations and peoples want the same things as Americans will not fly
and is open to derision. It reflects blithe liberal cultural imperialism, among other things.
(See Graham Greene. And, on the contrary, some nations—and peoples—seek nuclear
weapons, like Iran; some don't want to curb global warming, like China; some don't care
about human rights, like most Arab nations; some have contempt for democracy,
including de facto allies like Egypt, not to mention Myanmar; and some are indifferent to
poverty, any number of African kleptocracies.) Also there is some confusion of
definitions, for example, asserting dialogue with adversaries is &quot;strategic engagement,&quot;
when that is a concept usually applied to allies and partners.
4. The speech must be crafted with a sense of real time and cannot be delivered out of sync
with it. Slogans can become shopworn, especially those that lack analytical, historical
and descriptive power. What served you once, at your confirmation, may not serve again
in the same way. The most cogent foreign policy columnists from Clive Crook of the
Financial Times to David Rothkopf of Foreign Policy have already written columns in
the last week on the limits of &quot;soft power&quot; (i.e., &quot;smart power&quot;) and others I understand
are preparing to make similar criticisms. I would use sparingly or not at all. You do not

S Specials, Hume — I'd be grateful if you could pass this to $, for her information. Thank you.

Madam Secretary: I want to let you know about a temporary rotation in Benghazi. TNC Envoy Chris Stevens has been
on the road since March 13, when he began his outreach mission, and has been in Benghazi since April 5.
discussed this with Bill Bums today. Bill and I support this request and look forward to
the opportunity to discuss with Chris the way forward with the INC.
I know how important it is to have continual coverage (security conditions permitting) in Benghazi. I will send Embassy
Tripoli's DCM Joan Polaschik to serve as Acting Envoy during Chris' absence. Like Chris, she knows many of the TNC
leaders from her time in Tripoli. Since her return to Washington, she's been working with Gene and NEA on Libya
policy and also been coordinating many of the support issues for the team in Benghazi.

At behest of PDT, I tried to call you just minutes ago to ask about your availability for phone call from him this afternoon.
-First choice: 5:00 p.m. (your time)
-Alternative: 7:00 p.m.
- If neither works for you, then propose time and we'll accomodate.
Two options to suggest:
1.With our individual cell phones, it is difficult to involve third person - to wit, me. Could you arrange for a confeiBi ce
type number and code to which PD and I could call separately?
1.4(B)
2.Or as alternative, do you have capacity to call us separately to turn it into a conference call?
1.4(D)
Either option would not only make for a smoother conversation, but would also allow me to not have to be in same
location as PDT
so best that call be today.

    <body>Had dinner last night (Tuesday, February 16) with Joschka Fischer. We had an interesting
conversation on Iran and Saudi Arabia, among other things. (As you know Fischer is now
director of the Nabucco pipeline project.) On Iran, harsh, targeted sanctions are absolutely
necessary, but are most effective diplomatically when always coupled with an offer to negotiate.
The iron fist in the velvet glove approach achieves several objectives: According to Fischer's
intelligence, Ahmanijehad wished some negotiated settlement but was blocked. The regime has
splits at the top. Perhaps true, perhaps not. But constantly pushing negotiations alongside
sanctions puts additional pressure on internal divisions, whatever they are. Extending an open
hand while brandishing a stick closes diplomatic and political room to maneuver for Iran. Its
refusal to accept the open hand justifies application of the stick. Even when sanctions are
enforced it always remains useful to say another way is open. The damage done to Iran is
therefore the result of its own choice. This approach also aids the opposition. A purely condign
sanctions strategy can contribute to the regime's will to punish and tighten repression. Talking of

You may have already heard this, but wanted to alert you that Senator Dorgan this evening announced
that he would not seek reelection and is retiring.
He would have been up for reelection in November but his numbers were solid and he wasn't facing a
particularly strong field.
Below is a copy of his statement:
&quot;Over this holiday season, I have come to the conclusion, with the support of my family, that I will not be
seeking another term in the U.S. Senate in 2010. It is a hard decision to make after thirty years in the
Congress, but I believe it is the right time for me to pursue these other interests. Let me be clear that
this decision does not relate to any dissatisfaction that I have about serving in the Senate. Yes, I wish
there was less rancor and more bipartisanship in the U.S. Senate these days. But still, it is a great
privilege to serve and I have the utmost respect for all of the men and women with whom I serve.&quot;

Paul Simons called me shortly after earthquake hit Chile (8.5 Richter-- stronger than Haiti). He was going to reach out to
advance team. Marriott Hotel fine. Event frightening because of intensity of tremor. Epicenter near Concepcion-- third
largest city in Chile about 400 miles south of Santiago (city of Cauquenes--- hardest hit).
Just heard Bachelet on TV-- casualties so far 16-- though because communications down and it is still dark information is
preliminary. Some concern over risk of Tsunami though Navy deems unlikely. Fortunately, there is no collapse of dams.
Considerable damage to highway bridges and infrastructure--that will affect traffic-- in Talca hospital evacuated for
precautionary reasons. President declared zones of Maule and Bio Bio disaster areas.
Significant loss of life and damage unlikely because Chile suffered devastating earthquakes in 1939 and 1960 (the
strongest in recorded history) in same area so most old construction is gone. Chile has strong construction codes and

Subject: Re: Expo Update
I have asked Jose to get you a more detailed report but I must tell you the opening of the USA Pavilion has been a great
success so far - at least among the expo-goers. A few vignettes.
- while we don't want to brag to our Chinese hosts, our Pavilion has become the most popular. During the trial runs last
week, the Chinese expo-goers rushed directly from the gates to the USAP (and even broke some of our turn-styles).
Needless to say, the Chinese have improved security. On EACH of the first two days, 30,000 pple visited. Lines are long
and pple are loving the show. We are also getting many foreign officials to visit.
- the 100 US college student ambassadors (who act as guides and speak Mandarin) are the biggest hits of the pavilion.
Fair-goers stand in line to have their photo's taken w them. They explain the show and send a great message.
- the story line that we thght was simplistic is quite popular (the overture where Americans try to say hello in mandarin
is met w howls of laughter and Act II called the Garden is doing well). During the thunderstorm scene a mist comes from
the ceiling and some pple put up their umbrellas. Act I is a bit too commercial but the audience claps and take photo's
when you and President come on the screen.
- we are selling tons of USA merchandise - the two most popular items - mini-basketballs with the USAP seal on it and
the bison stuffed animals - who knew?
Anyway, thght u'd enjoy the quick report. I cannot imagine us not being here! We will keep you posted.
Smart power works!

    <subject>If bilateral talks fail, a regional approach</subject>
    <body>For your Sunday reading, a summary of an interesting proposal by former Jordanian foreign minister Marwan Muasher.
&quot;Palestinian-Israeli Direct Talks: The Case for a Regional Approach&quot;By Marwan Muasher (Carnegie Endowment Bulletin,
August 2010)
Marwan Muasher – former Jordanian foreign minister, ambassador, and deputy prime minister – advocates a regional
settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, capitalizing on the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative. His approach depends first
on securing end-game &quot;deposits&quot; from all parties: The parties would offer hypothetical commitments that they might
not be willing to give at the onset, but that can be &quot;deposited&quot; with the U.S. and committed to only if the other side is
willing to do the same. Saudi Arabia's deposit, for instance, would outline and agree to a package that included details
about Jerusalem. The Saudi package would also promise to secure Arab and Muslim backing for the painful compromises
the Palestinians would need to accept.
Muasher advocates a similar approach to the Syrian track—asking Syria to deposit end-game commitments in return for
full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. In their deposits, the Saudis and the Syrians must clearly commit to
address the inclusion of Hamas and Hezbollah in any regional agreement. The Arab states would not only have to end all
logistical, financial, and military support for these two groups, but they would have to assume responsibility for
delivering these two actors, helping to transform them into political players. Israel's deposit would spell out its
commitment to a solution based on 1967 borders and a return of the Golan.
According to Muasher, these deposits would make it much easier for President Abbas to engage in talks aimed at ending

CDM:
At behest of PDT, I tried to call you just minutes ago to ask about your availability for phone call from him this afternoon.
- First choice: 5:00 p.m. (your time)
- Alternative: 7:00 p.m.
- If neither works for you, then propose time and we'll accomodate.
Two options to suggest:
1.With our individual cell phones, it is difficult to involve third person - to wit, me. Could you arrange for a conference
type number and code to which PD and I could call separately?
2. Or as alternative, do you have capacity to call us separately to turn it into a conference call? 1.4(B)
Either option would not only make for a smoother conversation, but would also allow me to not have to be in same1.4(D)
location as PDT.

Cheryl: The Russians are trying to cash in on Angola's upside potential. With the Angola's oil and mineral wealth, as
well as its vast agricultural potential, the Russians see dollars signs in their eyes. I hope some American companies,
backed up with OPIC and Ex-Im Bank guarantees and loans, will go in to build housing and other infrastructure.

Editorial: Mrs. Clinton in Pakistan
NEW YORK TIMES
October 30, 2009
Hillary Rodham Clinton's first trip to Pakistan as secretary of state was never going to be easy. The day she arrived,
extremists detonated a car bomb at a crowded market in Peshawar that killed at least 100 people. The Nation
newspaper dismissed the visit as a mere &quot;PR exercise, but who will buy what the US is selling is difficult to imagine,
beyond the already compliant government.&quot;
Polls show that an overwhelming majority of Pakistanis dislike and mistrust the United States. They blame Washington
for using and then abandoning them after the Soviets were driven from Afghanistan. And they resent Washington for
pressing their government now to fight against extremists — and suspect that they will be abandoned again. The fact
that many of the extremists are on Pakistan's territory and threatening Pakistan's government has not shifted that
thinking or mitigated that resentment.
A good part of this, of course, is the failure of Pakistan's government, which has still not adequately explained that this is
not just America's fight. But the United States is also to blame. For eight years the Bush administration coddled the
Pakistani Army at the expense of the rest of society.
Mrs. Clinton challenged Pakistan's government to do more to shut down Al Qaeda, but she was, rightly, determined to
use this visit to also broaden the relationship.
Instead of just courting President Asif All Zardari and the army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, Mrs. Clinton also held
talks with the top opposition leader, Nawaz Sharif; parried questions from an audience of deeply suspicious college
students; met with civil society leaders, including women and Pashtun elders; gave interviews to Pakistani journalists;
and visited religious and cultural sights.
She promised to refocus American aid on the &quot;needs of the people&quot; and announced targeted commitments, including
$85 million for microloans for poor women to start businesses and $125 million for the first phase of an electricity
project aimed at reducing blackouts and improving energy conservation.
Those grants are welcome but still small change when compared with a five-year, $7.5 billion — nonmilitary — aid
package approved by Congress and signed into law this year. That package was supposed to demonstrate to Pakistanis
that, this time, the United States is in it for the long haul. Instead, it has become another focus of popular resentment.

Subject: RE: Honduran President Zelaya Reportedly Seized by Armed Forces
I am in the office and working with our Embassy in Tegucigalpa. Apparently, the action this morning was a coordinated
effort by the Supreme Court, the Honduran Congress, and the armed forces to prevent President Zelaya from holding a
non-binding poll on a possible constituent assembly. The Supreme Court determined the poll illegal and ordered the
military to collect all balloting materials. In the process of doing this, the military also seized Zelaya and supposedly sent
him by aircraft to Costa Rica.
Our Ambassador has his Emergency Action Committee convened at the Embassy. They are reaching out to all their
contacts to determine the current state of play. The Embassy will issue a warden message soon to U.S. citizens in
Honduras regarding events. I have called our Embassy in Costa Rica and asked it to confirm Zelaya's presence in San •
Jose. I will be calling the Costa Rican Foreign Minister soon. Tomorrow, Costa Rica takes over as President Pro Temp of
the Central American Integration System.
Hector Morales has been in touch with OAS SecGen Insulza. The OAS Permanent Council passed a resolution on Friday
offering its good offices to Honduras to resolve the political impasse, and Insulza was going to lead a team to Honduras
on Monday. We are checking to determine the state of play of the delegation, but OAS involvement will be key to a
successful resolution of this event.
I will also be calling the new SouthCom Commander to ensure a coordinated U.S. approach. We have big military
equities in Honduras through Joint Task Force Bravo at Soto Cano airbase.
We are working up press points now. Although this morning's events were part of a larger political and institutional
struggle in Honduras. The seizure and expulsion of the President was an intolerable act by the armed forces and we are
going to have to say this loud and clear.

VAN SUSTEREN: Senator, there is a report from the State Department that Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton will testify on Benghazi before the middle of January. There has been some criticism of whether or
not she has a concussion. I believe she has a concussion. What do you think?
MCCAIN: I know that in my view, Secretary Clinton, when she said she assumed full responsibility, she
certainly has a lot of responsibility for what happened in Benghazi. That's -- that report made that very
clear. But I must say, ,I have never seen Secretary Clinton back down from a fight And I have
never seen her back down. And I believe that she is now not physically well enough to testify
and she will testify the middle of 3anuary.

And good riddance. Why Jim Jones was the worst national

BY DAVID J. ROTHKOPF I OCTOBER 8, 2010
The president's inexperience did in Jones more than any of the general's deficits. He didn't know what he wanted. He
vacillated on key issues. He simply demonstrated the problems America repeatedly has when it hires men with no foreign-
policy background to take on the most important international job in the world. Further, he did not really know enough
about how the presidency works to nip in the bud the creation of the inner-circle bubble that effectively negated much of
the work that the formal policy process did. Obama encouraged (or tolerated for long-enough that it looks like
encouragement) his campaign foreign-policy deputies to continue to report directly to him, and this led to some public and
private backdooring of Jones that undercut his authority dramatically. He did not empower Jones, and that combined with

See bottom of message re the firsts.
These were innovations we pushed (particularly use of web for real time display of pledges and what initially was
described by those who did not like my idea as pay to play (or in this instance as I argued - it was pay to have a priority
speaking slot as those who did not have a pledge would get to speak, just not until the end).
Nice addition to our innovation and tech storyline.

Dear members of Team Pledge Data,
Jordan Ryan &lt; ; Mills, Cheryl D; Klevorick, Caitlin B;
I wanted to thank all of you for your excellent work leading up and at the Conference in establishing the system for
gathering, scrubbing, presenting, projecting, and posting the pledge data from all the donors. And to thank you for
accommodating so quickly my inchoate and sleep-deprived requests yesterday morning for the changes to the format of
what was projected.
But I wanted to make sure you realized that you accomplished something rather historic yesterday. You have
massively raised the bar for future donors' conference on how pledge data should be tracked and shared.
Here are some of the &quot;firsts&quot; that you should be proud of (based at least on my experience in 8 major donors'
conferences so far):
First to gather written pledges from all donors
- First to project individual pledges in real time at the conference
- First to release individual pledges to the world public and media on the same day as the conference
In addition to these, the work that you put into scrubbing the pledges — with the rigor and integrity of development
professionals — ensured that the pledge figures were more meaningful and accurate than for most other pledging
conferences (another possible first).

The article is good, just way too short, so it became very matter of fact, didn't include a lot of the great stuff he saw that
day. They cut what he turned in in half.
But for this readership, that length is probably perfect. It supposedly gets seen by 70 million people. 69 million
probably never open it up and just see it in their Sunday paper, so the cover is the ballgame. Story is basically an excuse
for the cover. And the cover is a homerun.
In the end, I firmly believe it will be the totality all these in-depth projects like Vogue, National Geographic, Nightline,
Time - which I know are annoying - that are going to create a collage documenting your success, especially in terms of
style and work ethic, which I believe is what people are most interested when it comes to their perception and approval
of you.

Indian PM shows solidarity with Pakistan against floods
ISLAMABAD, Aug. 19 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called his Pakistani
counterpart Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani over phone Thursday to convey the condolences and
commensurations of his government and the people of India on the loss of precious lives
and damage to the properties and infrastructure caused by floods in Pakistan.
The Indian prime minister said that the member States in the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation should come together to help Pakistan in every way possible at this
critical juncture, according to the Pakistani PM office.
Gilani thanked his Indian counterpart for his kind gesture of calling him to express his
sympathies and solidarity with Pakistan in its hour of trial.
He briefed the Indian prime minister over the huge damage caused by this unprecedented
natural calamity in all the provinces of the country, which, according to UN estimates,
was far bigger than the effects of earthquakes and tsunami which hit Pakistan in 2005 and
Haiti last year respectively.
Gilani also availed the opportunity to reiterate Pakistan's keen desire to have friendly,
cooperative and good neighborly relations with India.
He hoped that in accordance with the agreement reached in Thimphu in Bhutan in April, the
bilateral dialogue between the two countries would progress a meaningful, substantive and
result- oriented way by addressing all the issues of concern to both countries including
Kashmir dispute.

Dear Madam Secretary:
I greatly appreciate your support of our efforts to improve USG outreach to the European Parliament (EP) and
wanted to provide you with a brief update on our progress. We have worked very hard at USEU to deepen and
intensify our relationship with the EP over the past several months. Specifically, we have,
(1) Increased the flow of high-level USG visitors to the EP. Recent visitors include Janet Napolitano, Dick
Holbrooke, George Mitchell, Dick Morningstar and Ron Kirk. These visits culminated last month in a
highly successful address by VP Biden to a Plenary Session of the EP. I hope that you will also address
a Plenary Session of the EP in the near term. (Your town hall meeting at the EP with young leaders last
year was well-received here.)
(2) Increased the flow and quality of EP interactions in Washington. We have facilitated a dramatic
increase in the number of EP delegations visiting Washington and a significant improvement in the level
of their access to high-level USG officials.
(3) Increased USEU outreach to the EP at every level. At the Mission, we are restructuring the way in
which we interact with EP leaders by institutionalizing responsibility for key relationships and
enhancing accountability. In the coming months, we expect to receive two additional FTEs at the
Mission to improve our ability to cover the EP. We have also encouraged our Embassies in member
State capitals to meet with European Parliament members.

Subject: Palau offended by US positions
Below is the statement of very impressive Palau reps at the end of a session of required meetings on the next phase of
free association aid. FYI only, the Palauans were insulted by the nature and depth of the response to their proposal as
well as the content and the overall approach. They are even privately questioning the relationship. (This hasn't affected
their intent to take the Uighurs.) I will send a few further thoughts.
At the conclusion of yesterday's meeting, the Palau delegation caucused to discuss its reaction to the response of the
United States delegation to the proposals that it made in June in Washington D.C., and expanded upon in subsequent
communications.
While the Palau delegation has agreed to respond to certain additional questions raised by the United States delegation
on specific elements of the Palau proposal, and further has agreed to participate in certain working groups on specific
issues, the Palau delegation was deeply disappointed with the response of the United States delegation. The United
States delegation did not seriously respond, as required by the Compact, to the operational requirements of the
Government of Palau or to Palau's comprehensive and considered plans to achieve economic advancement and self-
sufficiency.
In light of the foregoing, the Palau delegation has determined that it must now return to Palau to discuss with President
Toribiong the next steps that Palau needs to take regarding the Compact. Thank you.

long transitions so it's not distracting. I've folded the images into the text I'm sending you, but you'll have a
teleprompter on stage tomorrow.

Hi Cheryl — hope you're holding up ok with all of the Haiti work.
I'm having a little reception on 3/22 6pm over at the OAS to celebrate my swearing-in. I'd love it if you could come by
for a glass of champagne and a little jazz music!
I'd love to invite the Secretary. Is that even proper protocol? Although she probably couldn't attend, I'd like to share it
with her. Your thoughts?

    <body>Setup for foreign policy TV debate on Thursday. Obviously, this is a popular position. Clegg is now at the height of his
popularity and playing to public opinion. Clegg is pushing off both Brown (still suffering from Obama's dismissive slights,
unpopularity of Afghanistan, and, deepest factor, Bush poisoning of the well) and Cameron (making him an old
Thatcherite, pro-US, anti-EU). Clegg is an ardent Europeanist, not so much Americanist.

Clegg: special relationship with US is over
Tue Apr 20 2010 20:38:43
ctThe &quot;special relationship&quot; between Britain and the United States is over, Nick Clegg has said.
The Liberal Democrat leader said Barack Obama's administration &quot;understood the world had changed&quot; and the UK's
leaders needed to end their &quot;slavish&quot; devotion to Washington.
Mr Clegg also warned against &quot;sabre-rattling&quot; over Iran's nuclear ambitions and repeated his pledge to offer a referendum
on the UK's continued membership of the European Union when the issue next arose.
The Lib Dems have ruled out replacing Trident with a like-for-like system and Mr Clegg said the UK should consider &quot;not

Subject: Q re HbJ
Jake,
The Secretary asked me this afternoon about timing for a call/meeting with Hb1 on the Syrian opposition. I told
her wanted to consult with Robert to double check on this:
Robert agrees that 1-1131 remains quite involved in the Syria issue. For instance, when he was in the London meeting on
the Syria opposition just before UNGA, the Qatari rep got Hill on the phone in minutes during the meeting to weigh in
on a Q re the SNC — and HbJ's view carried the day.
We are now sending to Amb Susan Ziadeh the list of organizations that we want to Qataris to contact inside Syria to ask
them to choose reps to send to Doha. We are also sending her the list of names we are socializing for consideration for
the 'political council&quot; Susan can discuss these lists in Doha on Sunday, so it would make sense for S to wait until
Monday or Tuesday to engage with HbJ on some of these ideas for managing the conference and its outcomes.
Robert confirms that there is a lot of talk about the Doha meeting being postponed for a few days, but there is no new
firm date. We are quite comfortable with a delay as it gives us (and others) time to press for good
representation/participation and a better outcome. The idea of a follow-on conference in Cairo is still very much alive.
She suggested she might also check with Hb1 on whether he is planning a trip here anytime soon. Meeting him in person
would be great if he's planning a trip here.
II send a note up on Monday with some ideas on the Libya meeting that the Secretary asked about.

The Death of Polish President Kaczynski and His Delegation
I join President Obama in offering my deepest condolences to the people of Poland, to the Kaczynski family, and to the
families of all those killed in this tragedy. Lost alongside President Kaczynski and his wife were Polish leaders from
across the political spectrum, men and women who shaped and sped Poland's post-1989 democratic transformation and
were leading Poland into its promising future. The tragedy of these lives cut short will be felt deeply across the world,
but their legacy will live on in a free and flourishing Poland.
The United States stands with the Polish people in this difficult hour. Like the country he led, President Kaczynski was
one of America's most valued and trusted allies. He was well known in the United States as a champion for democracy

&quot;Part of the problem is structural: The
Defense Department budget exceeds
$600 billion a year, while the State Department
receives only $50 billion. But
part of the problem is personal: In private,
Team McChrystal likes to talk shit
about many of Obama's top people on the
diplomatic side. One aide calls Jim Jones,
a retired four-star general and veteran
of the Cold War, a &quot;clown&quot; who remains
&quot;stuck in 1985.&quot; Politicians like McCain
and Kerry, says another aide, &quot;turn up,
have a meeting with Karzai, criticize him
at the airport press conference, then get
back for the Sunday talk shows. Frankly,
it's not very helpful.&quot; Only Hillary Clinton
receives good reviews from McChrystal's
inner circle. &quot;Hillary had Stan's back during
the strategic review,&quot; says an adviser.
&quot;She said, 'If Stan wants it, give him what
he needs.'
&quot;McCluystal reserves special skepticism
for Holbrooke, the official in charge
of reintegrating the Taliban. &quot;The Boss
says he's like a wounded animal,&quot; says a
member of the general's team. &quot;Holbrooke
keeps hearing rumors that he's going to
get fired, so that makes him dangerous.
He's a brilliant guy, but he just comes in,
pulls on a lever, whatever he can grasp
onto. But this is COIN, and you can't just
have someone yanking on shit.&quot;
At one point on his trip to Paris, Mc-
Chrystal checks his BlackBerry. &quot;Oh,

gams. &quot;I don't even want to open it.&quot; He
clicks on the message and reads the salutation

This is simply a quick note to thank you for the inscribed Mongolian-language copy of Secretary Clinton's memoir which

Sheikha Moser has approached me privately saying they are keen to get their relationship with the USA onto a more

Hi Cheryl,
I do not believe there is Twittering in the Secretary's name. The Twittering is from DipNote, the State Department's Blog

It will occasionally quote the Secretary but the Twittering should not be done in her name.

But we should not be twittering in the Secretary's name since she is not the person actually twittering.

    <body>MUSCAT (AP) - An American woman released from Iran after more than 13 months in custody began her journey back to
the United States after asking her supporters to &quot;extend your prayers&quot; to her fiancé and another American man who
remain in Tehran accused of spying. In a brief statement, Sarah Shourd thanked Oman for mediating the $500,000 bail
that led to her freedom earlier this week. But she made no mention of her ordeal inside Tehran's notorious Evin Prison
or any health problems- which her mother has said include a breast lump and precancerous cervical cells. &quot;Please,
please extend your prayers&quot; to the other two Americans still held- her fiancé Shane Bauer and their friend Josh Fattal-
she said at Oman's international airport before boarding an Oman Air flight on the first leg of her trip home
accompanied by her mother Nora and an uncle. She was next scheduled to appear at a news conference in New York on
September 19 timed to coincide with the arrival of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to attend the UN General
Assembly. Shourd, 32, appeared in good spirits and less gaunt than when she stepped off a private Omani jet after her
release from Iran. She thanked Omani officials for playing an intermediary role between Iran and the United States for
her release. &quot;I'll always associate your country with the first breath of my freedom, the sweet smell of sandalwood and

    <body>Background on the Women Deliver Conference CONTEXT The second Women Deliver conference will take place in
Washington, DC on June 7-9, 2010. This conference is an international gathering that focuses on maternal health and
will include an estimated 3,000 representatives from governments, civil society, multilateral organizations, and the
private sector. The aim of the conference is to generate political commitment and financial investment for fulfilling
Millennium Development Goal 5, which pledges a three-quarter reduction in maternal mortality and universal access to
reproductive health by 2015. The conference is one of several international gatherings this year that will include a focus
on maternal and child health (MCH). As you know, this issue will also feature at the G-8, where the Canadians are
offering a flagship initiative on MCH, and at the Millennium Development Goals Summit in September, where the UN
Secretary General is sponsoring a Joint Effort on Women and Children's Health. The US will be represented at the
Women Deliver conference by Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, Undersecretary of State Maria
Otero, Ambassador Melanne Verveer, and a host of other USG participants. Please note: You recently recorded a video
message that will open the conference.
The full script is below.
SUGGESTED TALKING POINTS
• For too long and in too many places, women have received inadequate care when they give birth. As a result,
childbirth remains a leading cause of death and injury to women worldwide. • The United States has elevated the
issue of maternal health in our development work through the Global Health Initiative, a $63 billion dollar proposal to
help countries improve health outcomes through strengthened health systems and integrated service delivery, with a
particular focus on the health of women, newborns and children. This conference—along with other international
gatherings this year, including the G-8 and the Millennium Development Goals Summit in September—presents a unique
opportunity to reinvigorate our commitment to maternal health. • When women prosper, their families and
communities prosper. Women deliver for the world – now the world needs to deliver for them. ADDITIONAL
BACKGROUND The theme of this year's Women Deliver conference is &quot;Delivering Solutions for Girls and Women,&quot; with a
focus on political, economic, social/cultural, and technological solutions. Conference organizers plan to emphasize the
following messages:1) The Millennium Development Goals will not be achieved without investing in
women.2) There is just enough time, if the world commits funding now, to achieve Millennium Development Goal 5—
an additional US $10 billion annually by 2010 and US $20 billion by 2015.Women Deliver was launched at a conference
in London in 2007. Jill Sheffield is the President of the organization.
FINAL VIDEO SCRIPT WOMEN DELIVER CONFERENCEWASHINGTON, DC
I am delighted to welcome all of you to this conference and to thank you for the work you are doing to put maternal
health at the top of our development agenda. Your commitment to this issue has raised awareness and inspired action
around the world. We know that women represent our greatest opportunity for progress in this century. If the potential
of women is fully developed, everyone benefits. And this can't be done without improving maternal health. But for too
long and in too many places, women have received inadequate care when they give birth. As a result, childbirth remains
a leading cause of death and injury to women worldwide. The United States has elevated this issue in our development
work through the Global Health Initiative, a 63 billion dollar proposal to help countries improve health outcomes

entities. In bilats today, I learned that some G77 countries are wondering what's in it for them. They're not developing
countries and they're not the UK or US. Brazil may be second guessing the creation of the new agency yet this is an
agency that will benefit women everywhere. I don't know if you'll have an opportunity to say to Brazil's leader that we

In the past 48 hours, the political situation in Pakistan has entered a new phase. The Supreme Court ruled the NRO
illegal and paved the way for prosecution of several government officials, most notably Interior Minister Rehman Malik.
Malik has been summoned before the Court and the Defense Minister (along with 247 other officials) was barred from
traveling to China on an official visit. Vali Nasr has been following the fast-moving and still unclear developments
closely.
In addition, the Supreme Court has opened the door to new petitions to be filed, questioning

There are a number of different possibilities for how the decision on the Guinea/Madagascar credentials may go

We may have to vote on a motion to *deny* them credentials and exclude them. For the moment, the guidance is to

Sorry to flood your email, but I couldn't resist sending this to you from Ben Smith.
A year later, Hillary wins
A year ago today, the final set of primaries made official the foregone conclusion that Barack Obama had won the
primary, and Hillary Clinton lost it.
There's far too much going on today to dwell on an anniversary, but it does seem worth noting one particular piece of
news in its light: On the central health care policy debate of the Democratic Primary -- which was, to be fair, conducted
within a fairly narrow frame -- Obama appears to have conceded today to a Senate plan likely to more closely resemble
Clinton's.
In a dense, careful letter &lt;http://www.politico.com/static/PPM118_090603_healthcare_ltr.html&gt; to Ted Kennedy nd
Max Baucus, Obama offered his principles &lt;http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0609/23298.html&gt; for a health care
plan and conceded on a central point: He is now open to an individual mandate, which he campaigned against, and
which is now being talked about by Senators of both parties with the buzzword &quot;shared responsibility.&quot;
Obama still backs a &quot;hardship waiver&quot; for people unable to afford the mandate -- which is consistent with the core of his
objection to the mandate. But what he cast as a principled difference of approach -- was the problem merely that
people couldn't afford insurance? or something more? -- seems to have been conceded.
Here's the relevant paragraph:
I understand the Committees are moving towards a principle of shared responsibility -- making every American
responsible for having health insurance coverage, and asking that employers share in the cost. I share the goal of ending
lapses and gaps in coverage that make us less healthy and drive up everyone's costs, and I am open to your ideas on
shared responsibility. But I believe if we are going to make people responsible for owning health insurance, we must
make health care affordable. If we do end up with a system where people are responsible for their own insurance, we

Dear Cheryl,
I want you to know that last month a friend of mine convinced me to apply for a fellowship at Harvard/Institute of
Politics, and I did. A few days ago, I got a call from the Program Director who informed me that I was accepted. I am very
excited about it and think it will be a very good opportunity to share my experience with students who
are learning theories about democracy and development.
Cheryl, I am going to be bold and ask you if you would accept my invitation to come and speak to the students while I
am there. I am asked and encouraged to invite important personalities who can talk of their experience in government
and I thought of you. I would be thrilled if you accept. I will be there from end of January until the beginning of May next
year. I have also invited President Moreno of IDB who accepted and I am waiting for an answer from Michaelle Jean, the
General Governor of Canada.
I wish you the very best, to you and your family for Christmas and the New Year. I hope our roads cross again as we
thrive to better the lives of so many people who deserve it. Please extend my wished to the Secretary of State. I admire
her and her work.

    <body>Subject Posner response to Washington Post editorial
Philippe and Jake asked me to send along this response to the Washington Post editorial:
By Michael Posner
The Post's Dec. 27 editorial (&quot;Redefining Human Rights&quot;) on the Obama Administration's human rights and
democracy policies, and Secretary Clinton's recent speech at Georgetown in particular, misses the critical point:
human rights, democracy, and development are mutually reinforcing, not competing goals. They complement
each other in the task of making human rights a human reality.
President Roosevelt understood the fundamental link between liberty, prosperity and security, tying together
freedom of speech and worship with freedom from want and freedom from fear in his famous &quot;Four Freedoms&quot;
speech. At Georgetown, Secretary Clinton articulated a 21st century vision grounded in this wisdom.
To accuse Secretary Clinton of embracing a Soviet-bloc approach to human rights because she includes
development in a discussion of democracy not only strains the bonds of credulity and common sense, it also
walls off a crucial avenue for ensuring that people can actually exercise the rights that are naturally theirs -
including the rights to freedom of religion, association, and speech-in their daily lives.
As Secretary Clinton made clear, policies that address development alone are not adequate: &quot;Freedom doesn't
come in half measures, and partial remedies will not solve the whole problem,&quot; she said. But experience shows
us that where broad-based development occurs, people are more likely to demand a say in securing their futures,
and governments are more likely to have the resources to maintain the strong institutions, including reliable
police and fair courts, that help ensure the consistent protection of rights. Where people are given the right to
speak freely, to participate in their nation's political process and have access to basic information about
government, sustainable development is more likely to occur. At the same time, democracies without
development do not last. These are mutually reinforcing tracks, and the Obama Administration is committed to
pursuing both simultaneously.
As President Obama said in his Nobel lecture, &quot;engagement with repressive regimes lacks the satisfying purity
of indignation.&quot; But the Post's overheated outrage ignores the lessons learned by generations of men and women
who worked to advance human rights around the world.

    <body>Here's the update, pieced together from various sources:
Starting at around 3 pm Friday, Adams and McGuinness returned to Hillsborogh to meet with Robinson and Arlene
Foster. The four talked privately for several hours and then asked for the draft papers to review. The discussion
continued until around 1 am when the parties left Hillsborough. (Foster's presence is apparently very helpful. Her
relationship with the SF leaders is much more positive and direct, treating them as equal colleagues.)
Woodward and Irish FM Martin will meet with Adams and Robinson separately this afternoon to assess where the talks
are. The talks last night/early morning ended more positively and if that is still the case there may be a decision to push
on today to see if agreement can be reached. It is equally possible that the two ministers and DUP/SF will decide to
wind up today and resume on Monday.
Brown and Cowen have spoken this morning and will speak again late this afternoon.
The issue is still parades. Robinson needs some certainity of change on parades. It is important for him politically within
the DUP, but also externally since this has become a symbol of whether he has achieved something or compromised too
much. Adams and SF have moved very far from their original positions on parades, adding that Robinson has also

VIOLENCE IN HAITI AS MANIGAT, CELESTIN ADVANCE TO RUNOFF
(SBU) Announced results conflicted with the EU-backed National Observation Council's preliminary reports
that Michel Martelly led government-backed candidate Jude Celestin in the vote, media report. Embassy Port-
au-Prince reports civil society representatives took care in announcing early findings, but the information was
reported locally as hard fact. Post notes gunfire could be heard throughout Port-au-Prince after results were
announced late December 7.

MBEKI MEETS WITH SUDANESE LEADERS TO DISCUSS ABYEI
(SBU) Thabo Mbeki, head of the African Union Panel on Sudan, described the meeting with President Bashir
and First Vice President Kiir as positive, according to press. The Office of the Special Envoy for Sudan comments
the meeting was held to discuss an African Union paper outlining options for resolving the Abyei issue. Bashir
and Kiir committed to meet one-on-one to develop a solution and said they would keep Mbeki informed as their
discussions progress.

DPRK CONDUCTS ARTILLERY DRILL NEAR MARITIME BORDER
(SBU) The drill, heard in the Republic of Korea, was contained within Democratic People's Republic of Korea

pressure to show restraint and likely connected to Admiral Mullen's visit to the ROK. (Ops/Embassy Seoul e-

Points:
- We condemn the effort to remove Zelaya from office.
- We are working within the OAS and with our regional partners to resolve this situation quickly and in a manner that
restores democratic order.
- We appreciate the role Spain played in winning quick EU condemnation of the coup attempt.
- Our work is not done. Rebuilding trust among competing political institutions and reducing polarization within
Honduras will take a lot of work. We hope Spain will work with us and the OAS to ensure a restoration of democratic

could pour tons of money into the United States political scene, potentially swaying the political climate.
The biggest questions with this ruling is the scope of the term &quot;corporation,&quot; says Edward Foley, law professor at the Ohio
State University College of Law and director of the election-law program. Does the high court want this decision to apply

Given the Israelis' warning, this is a real If.
Karl/Frank will go in today to walk Karzai through the particulars of the visit - the only thorny part is that it has dropped
from 4 to 3 days. But it has all the same elements, plus a dinner with Biden.
Did you see reports that Iran has dropped out of the running for the UNSC? Trying to confirm.
Andrew S. will be sending you a long memo that responds to DOD's pooling proposals - it conveys a desire to work
together with DOD on this and offers some alternative ideas. He also canvassed the building on other topics and will
send a list up for your book tonight. He and I agreed that the list should just be for reference and that your approach of

New York, NY -- September 20, 2010 — &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; anchor and managing editor Brian Williams
interviewed President Jimmy Carter to discuss the release of his new book &quot;White House Diary.&quot; The interview
airs tonight on &quot;NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams.&quot;
BRIAN WILLIAMS: The last photo of you with your-- fellow former presidents, you were well off to the side

JIMMY CARTER: No. I-- I feel that my role as a former president is probably superior to that of other

MEDIA NOTE
Joint Statement on the Upcoming Sudan National Elections
Following is the text of a joint statement by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas
Store, and United Kingdom Foreign Secretary David Miliband on the upcoming national elections in Sudan.
Begin Text:
National elections in Sudan this month will represent a major milestone in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement that
ended Sudan's twenty-two year civil war, and are an important opportunity for the people of Sudan to participate in the
political process.
We urge all parties in Sudan to work urgently to ensure that elections can proceed peacefully and credibly in April. We
are deeply concerned by reports of continued administrative and logistical challenges, as well as restrictions on political
freedoms. We call on the Government of Sudan, the National Elections Commission, and all political parties to engage in
further dialogue to resolve practical obstacles, procedural impediments, and address allegations of intimidation,
harassment, and safety concerns, and other legitimate concerns raised by various political parties. We continue to urge
the parties to improve conditions on the ground in Darfur and create a secure environment conducive to Darfuri
participation.
Irrespective of the outcome of elections, it is essential that work continues and is accelerated to meet remaining CPA
deadlines. Progress is needed urgently to complete border demarcation, to establish the commissions that will

this week David was for many years the president of the
New World Foundation. During that period the Secretary served on the board of the foundation
and worked with David. His family would like the Secretary to be informed of David's
death. Incidentally when I worked at the NSC I walked David over to the White House for a
private meeting with the First Lady which was just the two of them. I can provide additional
details on the memorial service if she were interested but the family's concern was only that she
be informed. Mort

First-Ever NHL-CHL Exhibition Game Helps Break International Ice in St. Petersburg: Thanks to U/S
Judith McHale who brought National Hockey League VP Ken Yaffe to Moscow under the auspices of the U.S.-
Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission for an icebreaker with Continental Hockey League representatives, St.
Petersburg's beloved SKA hockey team hosted the Carolina Hurricanes for an exhilarating exhibition game at
the Ice Palace. From the opening ceremony featuring both the U.S. and Russian national anthems, the capacity
crowd of 4,500 — including St. Petersburg Governor Valentina Matviyenko, SKA owner and Gazprom
Chairman Alexey Miller, Hurricanes owner and Compuware Corporation CEO Peter Karmanos, Jr., and U.S.
Consul General Sheila Gwaltney — cheered the two teams on. The heart-pounding, high-scoring game included
dazzling play by the 'Canes Eric Staal and Jeff Skinner (Carolina's game MVP) plus SKA favorites Alexei
Yashin (SKA's game MVP) and Maksim Sushinski. With Rossiya TV announcing that &quot;we've waited 20 years
for this,&quot; SKA broke the second period tie and led their team to a 5-3 victory over the 'Canes in the last
period. SKA's enthusiastic organ player rocked the crowd with themes from &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and &quot;The Addams
Family&quot; — plus Tina Turner's &quot;Simply the Best&quot; — and helped the Russian crowd give their home team their
traditional electrifying support. Continuing the &quot;sports diplomacy&quot; after the game, dozens of avid Russian
hockey fans waited patiently by the team buses and were elated when 'Canes Goalie Cam Ward signed
autographs and posed for photographs with them. The Russian crowd's enthusiasm for this match as well as
their admiration for the American team were ice-crystal clear from the capacity crowd (the stadium only sells
out for championship matches or games against their arch rival Moscow team), their cheers for the Hurricanes,
plus the extensive media presence, including live nation-wide coverage on Rossiya TV.

From The Sunday Times
February 28, 2010
Gordon Brown on course to win election
David Smith and Jonathan Oliver
GORDON BROWN is on course to remain prime minister after the general election as a new Sunday Times poll reveals
that Labour is now just two points behind the Tories.
The YouGov survey places David Cameron's Conservatives on 37%, as against 35% for Labour — the closest gap
between the parties in more than two years.
It means Labour is heading for a total of 317 seats, nine short of an overall majority, with the Tories languishing on a total
of just 263 MPs. Such an outcome would mean Brown could stay in office and deny Cameron the keys to No 10.
The poll result presents the Conservative leader with one of the greatest challenges of his leadership today as he makes
the keynote speech to his party's spring forum.
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Cameron defied his right-wing critics who believe the party's modernisation has
gone too far. He said: &quot;Some people say to me, 'Play things safe; try to win by default — the government is in a mess.' I
say, 'No. This is the Conservative party that is offering radical change. I'm doubling up on change'.&quot;
With the expected May 6 election now just over two months away, Cameron will seek to reconnect with voters through a
series of pledges, including a plan to restore discipline in schools. In an echo of the speech that won him the Tory
leadership in 2005, he will address the Brighton conference without notes.
&quot;This is very, very clear,&quot; he said. &quot;I've made my choice. There is no going back. This election is about change and we will
be offering change.&quot;
Cameron insisted he was unconcerned about the collapse in Tory support. &quot;The polls move around a lot,&quot; he said. &quot;The
voters tell us that they want change. They want to know the Conservative party itself has changed.&quot;
The narrowing of the Conservative lead has been dramatic and rapid. Until January the Tories held close to a 10-point
lead. But a week ago a Sunday Times YouGov poll put the gap at six points, suggesting a hung parliament, with the
Tories still on course to become the largest party.
In the last election, in 2005, support for the parties generally held steady in the run-up to polling day. YouGov polling for
The Sunday Times showed Labour leads of between two and five points from January through to the June election.
Labour's margin of victory was three points.
In today's poll, Labour has risen two points on the previous week, from 33%, while the Conservatives have dropped two
from 39%. The Liberal Democrats are unchanged on 17%.
The collapse in the Tory poll lead will put pressure on the pound in financial markets tomorrow by adding to fears that a
hung parliament will mean insufficient action is taken to cut Britain's budget deficit.
The last time the gap between the two main parties came this close and the Tory support was so low was in autumn 2007.

With prodigious efforts by your entire team (Jeanne, Dana, and Ed Meier worked very hard with Pat and his people over
the past week on the last chapter in addition to Bill, Karen, both Jim and Don Steinberg and others at both State and
USAID), greatly aided by spectacular thinking and all-night editing from Jake, here are a much improved four chapters.
Among other things, the 4th chapter now showcases much of the great work jack and his team have already done.
In the final report we will have
1.An introductory 1-2 page letter from you
2. An exec summary (10-15 pp that can be read in lieu of entire doc)
3. An introduction framing the chapters in terms of leading thru civilian power;
4. A chapter on the global trends and policies driving our assessment of the capabilities we need (written but not yet
edited):
5. the attached 4 chapters;
6. a final chapter on the National Security Budget;
7. A conclusion.
With the edits/cuts this week we are on track to come in some 5,000-10,000 words shorter than the QDR.
We're working this week on roll-out strategies of every kind, as well as further revisions to fill holes and respond to your
and other comments.

Still working this through, but here is where we are thus far:
The majority of all countries that have direct presidential elections use a Two-Round system. The number appears to be
at least 58.
France, most Latin American countries, all five post-Soviet Central Asian republics, and many countries in francophone
Africa use TRS to elect their presidents. Elsewhere in Africa the system is used by Angola, Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana,
Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Sao Tome and Principe, the Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Sudan,
Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe; in Europe, apart from France, it is used by Armenia, Azerbaijan, Austria, Belarus,
Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Finland, Georgia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia
and Ukraine; and it is found in Afghanistan, Haiti, Indonesia, Iran, Timor-Leste and Yemen.

GAZA (Reuters) - The Islamist Hamas movement, whose charter advocates the elimination of Israel, would accept the
outcome of a Palestinian referendum on a future peace treaty with the Jewish state, its Gaza leader said on December 1.
Ismail Haniyeh, addressing a rare news conference in the Israeli-blockaded enclave, signaled a softening of Hamas's
long-standing position prohibiting the ceding of any part of the land of what was British-mandated Palestine until 1948.
&quot;We accept a Palestinian state on the borders of 1967, with Jerusalem as its capital, the release of Palestinian
prisoners, and the resolution of the issue of refugees,&quot; Haniyeh said, referring to the year of Middle East war in which

down the road as Jake outlines below - would be seen as a significant victory.
And as an added bonus, it would be an opportunity to highlight your personal dedication to and prioritization of human

Subject: Only Palau &amp; Israel vote w/US in UN
Wed., Palau was one of only two UN General Assembly members to vote with the US against a resolution calling
for an end to the US embargo of Cuba (Israel was the other). Even the two other states in free association with the US.
did not support the US position. Important officials in Palau wanted to abstain because of the drastic cut in U.S.
assistance that Alcy Frelick has insisted on but Pres. Toribiong decided to stick with the US. The proposal to cut the small
amount of assistance that Palau is receiving is ironic in light of the substantial increase in assistance pledged to the two
other freely associated states just a few years ago. It is also misinformed and misguided.

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
15th Anniversary of Srebrenica Genocide
Today we remember the tragic events in Srebrenica fifteen years ago. I join President Obama and the people of the
United States in offering our deepest condolences on this most solemn occasion. We honor the memories of the victims
and mourn with their families.
The United States stands with Bosnia and Herzegovina, and all countries in the region who wish to foster peace and
reconciliation. We remain committed to ensuring that those responsible for these crimes face justice. We recognize that
there can be no lasting peace without justice. It is only by bringing all responsible parties to account for their crimes that
we will truly honor Srebrenica's victims.
We are duty-bound — to the victims, to their surviving family members, and to future generations — to prevent such
atrocities from happening again. Our common faith in the value of freedom and peace unifies us and drives us to act.
That is why we are committed to working with all the communities that make up Bosnia and Herzegovina to move
forward and build a pluralistic, democratic state that can take its rightful place in the Euro-Atlantic community. A
prosperous, free, and unified Bosnia and Herzegovina is the most worthy monument to those who lost their lives at
Srebrenica and the best guarantee against such a tragedy ever repeating itself.

Good morning Roberta! Congratulations on a successful visit by the Secretary of State. We are looking forward to this
afternoon's teleconference. After opening remarks, Minister Cannon will ask Prime Minister Bellerive to speak and the UN
(we may only have DPKO LeRoy on line due to visit of Sec Gen to Haiti). He will then ask FM Amorim and Sec State
Clinton to provide their views on the situation and then open the floor to Kouchner and others. Response has been good
and most will be represented at FM level (Mexico/Espinosa may still be in flight from Japan, and Argentina and Costa
Rica will be Vice-Ministers).
There is as well agreement in principle to begin laying the groundwork for a broader Donors Conference on
Reconstruction and our offer to host a preparatory meeting on January 25th has been well received. However, early
indications are that the EU has a conflict as they have their General Relations and Foreign Relations meetings scheduled
for that day. As the EU would be essential for such a meeting we are scrambling to look for alternative dates. Given the
momentum we would rather go earlier than later. Minister Cannon would be available to host this on the weekend of the
23-24th of January (dinner on the 23rd, meeting on the morning of the 24th). However, I believe that Ambassador

Greetings from Bangladesh!!!
Bangladesh Foreign Minister Ms Dipu Moth will call on Secretary Clinton
on September 16 to discuss the details of the visit of Bangladesh Prime
Minister Ms Hasina Wazed to the USA during the UN General Assembly
meeting. Please see if the issues of Grameen Bank can be raised in a
friendly way.
I sought an appointment with the Prime Minister to brief her on our problems,
at the advice of the US ambassador in Dhaka. But it is now over six weeks,
her office never responded.
Almost every important person in Bangladesh congratulated me for receiving
the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Prime Minister and her party said not

Cheryl,
I know the book Dead Aid well. The ideas are not new. They are essentially the same ones that Bill Easterly
has proposed in his two books: The Elusive Quest for Growth and White Man's Burden. The essential
argument is that a top-down, &quot;big-plan&quot; approach to foreign assistance — the Jeff Sachs' approach - has not
worked in the past and will not work in the future.
Both Easterly and Moyo argue for a bottom-up approach that supports overall economic growth. They
emphasize expanding access to capital markets and low-cost financing, promoting better governance and
accountability, policy reform to enhance foreign investment, and support for market-driven social

    <body>Photo is gorgeous (and there are 20 more online, some are really great)
The article is good, just way too short, so it became very matter of fact, didn't include a lot of the great stuff he saw that
day. They cut what he turned in in half.
But for this readership, that length is probably perfect. It supposedly gets seen by 70 million people. 69 million
probably never open it up and just see it in their Sunday paper, so the cover is the ballgame. Story is basically an excuse
for the cover. And the cover is a homerun.
In the end, I firmly believe it will be the totality all these in-depth projects like Vogue, National Geographic, Nightline,
Time - which I know are annoying - that are going to create a collage documenting your success, especially in terms of
style and work ethic, which I believe is what people are most interested when it comes to their perception and approval
of you.

Subject: women and reconciliation
In light of our discussion re. women and reconciliation, I wanted to alert you to a recent incident that has
generated a great deal of concern among Afghan women. Two days ago, a local Taliban commander executed a
pregnant widow for having an &quot;illicit affair&quot; (the man was not punished). While there are varying accounts of
the incident, the authorities have confirmed that she was shot in the head several times after being flogged up to
200 times in Qadis district (which is completely under the control of the Taliban) of Badghis.Government
authorities have condemned the incident, noting that due process was not carried out.
In meetings today, Afghan women leaders, including some who in the past accepted reconciliation as inevitable,
expressed both fear and bitterness over the incident and shared concerns that such brutality against
women would be far more prevalent if reconciliation occurred. They noted frustration about the lack of
transparency in the government's reintegration and reconciliation processes. A number of women questioned
what the government is willing to bargain in order to achieve a peace settlement and the extent to which it is
prepared to roll women's rights back to appease the Taliban. They noted that women's rights are treated as a
nuisance by the government leadership rather than as an important element of the peace process.
Melanne also met with President Karzai and was dismayed when he told her that there weren't any women's
names on the list of potential candidates for the High Peace Council. Stanekzai is said to have come up with a
list of 300 names (FRIC reports that women were on the list) that has been wittled down to about 30 names.
While the list is far from being finalized, President Karzai does not currently appear to be prioritizing women's

H: fyi, leaked Luntz poll on Bibi policies; and many congrats to Huma! Sid
Below is a transcript from Israeli TV News Channel Ten on a leaked poll taken last week by Frank Luntz. Here's a
summary:
1. 56% of Americans agree with the claim that there is a humanitarian crisis in Gaza;
2. 43% of Americans agree with the claim that people in Gaza are starving;
3. 34% of Americans support the Israeli operation against the Flotilla;
4. 20% of Americans &quot;felt support&quot; for Israel following announcement of easing of Gaza closure.
Frank Luntz analyses Netanyahu's media performance in the flotilla affair
The figures are troubling and worrisome. If that is the situation with our great friend the US, it is easy to imagine the
situation in other, somewhat less sympathetic countries.
Channel Ten TV News, July 1 2010 20:38
Yaacov Eilon (host): Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considered to make an extremely persuasive presentation in
the world press. But a professional analysis by a US expert presented yesterday to his senior aides strongly criticizes him.
Netanyahu's messages on the flotilla caused more harm than good. Our political correspondent Chico Menashe has
obtained the report.
Chico Menashe: Criticism of Prime Minister Netanyahu's current PR messages and Israeli PR in general comes from the
international elite of media consultants and pollsters and from the mouth of Frank Luntz, considered one of the leading
American political consultants, a Republican pollster, a consultant to many governments throughout the world and to
dozens of the biggest corporations in the US. He was asked by the Jewish organization The Israel Project to check the
opinions of the American public on the messages Israel issued to the world during and after the flotilla events. The result
is a harsh document that primarily criticizes the media strategy of the person considered Israel's number one
propagandist in the world, Prime Minister Netanyahu.
Netanyahu: Once again Israel faces hypocrisy and a biased rush to judgment.
Chico Menashe: Every time Israeli speakers begin with accusing the international community, writes Luntz, they
lose their audience. For example, Netanyahu's comments after the flotilla about the world hypocrisy were rejected by
most of the American participants who listened to them. The findings were presented last night to senior members of
Netanyahu's Bureau. Luntz checked the opinions with focus groups, not a poll. He warns of a dangerous slide in the
public opinion of the only country considered pro-Israeli, the U.S. Israel misses simple opportunities to change world
public opinion, he writes, and the consequences are significant. The American public increasingly hesitates to accept
arguments that support Israeli positions.
Ehud Barak: There is no hunger in Gaza and no humanitarian crisis.
Netanyahu: There's no shortage of food, there's no shortage of medicine, there's no shortage of other goods.
Chico Menashe: Luntz says Israel must immediately stop using the argument that there is no hunger and no
humanitarian crisis in Gaza. He says this fatally destroys Israel's credibility in light of the images on the
television screens. Israel must admit that there is a problem, he says, to gain the listeners' sympathy [emphasis
mine]. Luntz finds the troubling figure that 56% of participants agree with the claim that there is a humanitarian crisis in
Gaza, and no less astonishing is that 43% of participants from the American public agree with the claim that people in
Gaza are starving. But even lifting the closure that was supposed to improve Israel's image missed the opportunity,
according to Luntz.
Netanyahu: Yesterday an important decision was made by the security cabinet. Its meaning is clear. On the one hand,

Pulse - automatically updates when you open it. If you look to the left of each name of the news org, you'll initially see a
circle like symbol. That means it's updating.
Oh, actually the problem you are having is that it needs to find WiFi - do you have WiFi in whatever home you're in now?
We just need to set that up once and it will subsequently connect whenever it senses that wifi.
And yes on Monday can spend some quality time.

&gt; Madame Secretary: After a tense day in which President Correa was slightly injured at noon by rioting and striking
police, and later was barred from leaving the hospital by the same, the army finally rescued him at 9pm last night. Some
military units, including the Navy unit in Guayaquil appeared to support the police. The police also occupied the national
congress. As the rescue took place, the head of the Ecuadoran Joints Chiefs of Staff issued a statement supporting the
president, and noting that the armed forces respect the rule of law &quot;in which the President [Rafael Correa] is the
maximum authority of the three branches.&quot; Things are now calm.
&gt; Reaction in the hemisphere was one of deep concern. The OAS adopted a resolution; South American presidents at the
call of UNASUR travelled to Buenos Aires and are likely to go on to Quito to support Correa. Several, including Garcia and
Santos, called Correa. Zapatero also spoke with him. ivioratinos tried to reach you at around 6prn last evening to convey
that news, I took the call.
&gt; As you know, we issued a statement of support for Correa. I also gave an interview to CNN in Spanish, which was re-
played frequently. I strongly recommend that you call Correa today to reiterate U.S. support for his government and to

Kyrgyzstan rejects Obama &quot;cooperation&quot; offer
U.S. President Obama has sent a personal appeal to Kyrgyzstan proposing ways to discuss &quot;expanding cooperation&quot;.
Kyrgyzstan will not reverse its decision to close a U.S. military air base which is used to supply American troops for
Afghanistan occupation, Kyrgyz Foreign Minister Kadyrbek Sarbayev said on Thursday. U.S. President Barack Obama has
sent a personal appeal to Kyrgyzstan proposing ways to discuss &quot;expanding cooperation&quot;.
But Bakiyev's office said in a statement it had received a letter from Obama praising bilateral relations. &quot;Moreover,
Barack Obama expressed hope to further strengthen various forms of cooperation between the United States and
Kyrgyzstan,&quot; the statement said without mentioning the air base issue. &quot;The decision to annul all agreements on the
Manas military air base has been taken and there is no turning back on this,&quot; he told the 24.kg news agency.

sector spending there is not the same as in other parts of the UK because of 40 years of troubles.
Political stability depends upon economic stability. Removing funding specifically threatens community
policing, creating a vacuum that the Real IRA and other men of violence would rush into. Cutting the
public sector would make it difficult to increase private sector investment. Does the new government
understand the US interest in NI and appreciate the fragility of the situation?
Defense and Foreign Policy Cuts. The new government program is to slash the deficit, cutting deeply into
government programs. This really cannot be done without defense and foreign policy reductions. Seek
claficiation on exactly whether and where these cuts be made. Will they affect Afghanistan policy and
over what schedule? How will cuts in the foreign service affect British influence in other areas?
Trident and Nuclear Deterrent. The coalition agreement between the Conservative and Liberal Democrats
allows the LDs to abstain in parliamentary votes on four issues that will apparently let the Tories have
their way: marriage tax allowances; nuclear power; college tuition fees; and Trident and the nuclear

Arias was very pleased. He even used the phrase &quot;beginning of the end of the de facto regime.&quot; He liked our
idea of diplomatic outreach and I assured him that San Jose would be a top destination for us. He also
strongly endorsed our plan to go to Brussels, Madrid and the Vatican. He himself has spoken frequently with

Draft Statement by the Secretary as Revised by Senator Mitchell
This Administration has, from the beginning, worked to bring about comprehensive peace in the Middle East, including a
two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. On that issue our approach has been three-fold: (1) to help build
the economy and capacity to govern of a Palestinian state; (2) to renew political negotiations to enable the earliest
possible establishment of that state; and (3) to achieve these in a manner that ensures the security of Israel and of the
Palestinians.
Consistent with Prime Minister Fayyad's plan for a future Palestinian state, and to support the political negotiations,
Tony Blair, as the Quartet representative, will intensify his partnership with Senator Mitchell to mobilize the efforts of
the international community: (1) to build support for the institutional capacity and governance of a future Palestinian
State; (2) to improve freedom of movement and access for Palestinians; (3) to encourage further private sector
investment; and (4) to bring change in the living conditions of the people in Gaza.

American SAR personnel discussed each specific site within the Montana with the

Recovery operations had already begun and seven bodies (if I

I enjoyed the opportunity to discuss the emerging potential that Haiti presents with the Secretary
of State and former President Clinton last night. I would like to take this opportunity to make a
brief suggestion for Thursday's trip to Haiti:
We discussed the catalytic role the United States could play in leveraging much needed private
investment in large scale job creation, for example through direct involvement of OPIC. In my
report I pointed out that the port in Port-au-Prince is the most expensive port in the Caribbean
and recommended the opening of new private ports. Ports remain a critical bottleneck to a job
creation strategy both in garment manufacturing and agriculture. They also play a pivotal role in
ensuring that some of the complementary imports necessary for the proposed road construction
projects can enter the country both in the required quantities and in a cost-effective and timely
manner. Elsewhere I have argued that spiraling prices in construction booms often mean that
available funds only go half way to the finishing line.
The Haitian authorities have already made inroads in addressing some of these inefficiencies and

WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton will soon announce that gay American diplomats will be
given benefits similar to those that their heterosexual counterparts enjoy, U.S. officials said Saturday.
In a notice to be sent soon to State Department employees, Clinton says regulations that denied same-sex couples and
their families the same rights and privileges that straight diplomats enjoyed are &quot;unfair and must end,&quot; as they harm U.S.
diplomacy.
&quot;Providing training, medical care and other benefits to domestic partners promote the cohesiveness, safety and
effectiveness of our posts abroad,&quot; she says in the message, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press.
&quot;It will also help the department attract and retain personnel in a competitive environment where domestic partner
benefits and allowances are increasingly the norm for world-class employers,&quot; she says.
&quot;At bottom, the department will provide these benefits for both opposite-sex and same-sex domestic partners because
it is the right thing to do,&quot; Clinton says.
Among the benefits that will now be granted gay diplomats: the right of domestic partners to hold diplomatic passports,
government-paid travel for their partners and families to and from foreign posts, and the use of U.S. medical facilities
abroad.

Oops my email acting up.
Eap is asking you to call Thai foreign minister kasit regarding the case of the russian arms dealer viktor bout. Are you ok
doing this call in the next day or so?
Below is call sheet and I also faxed to the house.
Purpose of Call: To underscore the importance we place on a the Royal Thai Government's successful appeal of the
court decision rejecting the extradition of Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout to the United States and the importance of
his continued detention pending the outcome of the appeal.
Background: On August 11, 2009, a Thai judge denied a U.S. extradition request of accused arms smuggler Viktor Bout
(pron: BOOT) to face trial in New York for conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals and officers; acquire and use anti-aircraft
missiles; and provide material support to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The Thai Attorney
General's Office will appeal the ruling. FM Kasit has been a strong ally on Burma and released a forward-leaning
Chairman's statement on behalf of ASEAN following ASSK's conviction.

    <body>I know you're embarked on another big trip and wish you well.
I met with Reema Navatany, Ela Bhatt's right hand, whom you know. She sends her greetings and underscored again
what you mean to them. SEWA is on the cutting edge of so many exciting developments.
We had a great conversation on many things, including how much women in the developing world can and must do to
address climate change and drive low tech green industries. In the villages, I could feel the pollution in my eyes and
throat -- so much needs to be done at the local level. Much pollution is produced because of the way women cook, etc.
When I get back, will work up some ideas on this. Delhi's been enshrouded in smog for the last couple days.
The SEWA project I visited 2 hours outside of Delhi was so impressive. Women who were among the poorst of the poor
had become businesswomen capable of traveling to London and Brussels to negotiate contracts with companies for
their embroidery etc We're going to have SEWA play a key role in the Vital Voices summit that you announced that will
take place here next year.
Maria Otero was still here when - arrived so she joined me for the SEWA mtgs.
I also went to one of Rushira Gupta's antitrafficking projects. You know her as we've been working with her thru WH
years. She got the global citizens award at CGI this year. I don't think I've seen worse conditions than what she's trying to
address. In Mumbai we launched an anti- trafficking campaign with Bollywood which brought in new players to the
cause.

On Wednesday, the IEC certifies the final results for 34 out of 35 constituencies in the Parliamentary Elections. The Chairperson of
the IEC noted that while results for Ghazni elections were not included in the final results due to &quot;technical issues,&quot; they would be
announced in the upcoming three to five days. The UN and US embassy issued statements welcoming the results and commending the
work of the IEC and ECC. While the Palace has not made any public comments, the Attorney General's office—which has served as
the Government's mouthpiece to challenge the election institutions—continues to question the election outcome, criticizing the UN
for endorsing the results and vowing that it will continue to investigate allegations of corruption and fraud in the IEC and ECC. In a
last minute effort to influence the election announcement, the Attorney General had called for the suspension of the IEC and ECC
spokesmen. The embassy has reported that the IEC and ECC have dismissed the Attorney General's comments as political posturing
intended to influence the outcome in Ghazni.
Demonstrations have been taking place in various parts of the country are likely to grow, given the Attorney General's comments. The
political leadership appears to be split along ethnic lines, with a number of prominent Hazara and Tajik leaders—including Amrullah
Saleh and Abdullah Abdullah—insisting that the election results in all 34 provinces being upheld, while Pashtun leaders—including
Ashraf Ghani—questioning the legitimacy of the election results in a number of provinces. The President has noted that he will confer
with his two Vice Presidents and jihadi leaders before commenting on the results. Vice President Khalili has been the key Hazara
leader working with the UN to broker a deal to resolve the Ghazni elections.

    <body>Subject Community of Democracies
Welcome back to an unbelievable snowy mess in DC!
I wanted to tell you that I met with the Lithuanian official who is heading up the Community of Democracies. Lithuania
has the lead for the next two years. They are extremely energetic and recognize that CD needs to be reinvigorated. It
was not given much leadership from us during the Bush years and besides democracy got a bad name — among other
reasons. Their plan is to create a few working groups focused on issues that are current and important with specific
practical goals and tangible results — among them, one will be focused on women and their critical role. As you know,
they have a female president, the EU has just established a Gender Institute in Vilnius and they remember Vital Voices
when you headed up the conference in Iceland and the successor conference which was held in Lithuania in 2001. We
talked about a more concerted commitment -- to advocating for women and the role they need to play in conflict
resolution (1325), helping women in Afghanistan and working to help women in eastern Europe and the Caucuses where
things appear to be going backwards in many ways (takes me back to our first-ever VV conference in Vienna).
I agreed that we would co-chair the gender working group with Lithuania.
The Lithuanians believe that in many ways the younger generation takes for granted what the older generation fought
for (they remember being a &quot;Captive Nation and how the US kept them going with an embassy when they was little
likelihood at the time that they'd ever become a democracy), and that today democracies are struggling in too many
places. It's as though we have to take back democracy's good name and focus it as a universal value to address the
critical challenges.
Mike Posner has the lead on CD. I talked to him about all of this. He is all for our doing the gender working group as

    <subject>Fw: (AP) Interview: Ahmadinejad says future is Iran's- added quotes</subject>
    <body>NEW YORK (AP) - Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said &quot;the future belongs to Iran,&quot; and challenged the United
States to accept that his country has a major role in the world. The comments came in an hour-long interview with The
Associated Press on the first day of his visit to the United States to attend the annual general assembly of the United
Nations this week. He insisted that his government does not want an atomic bomb- something he has said in the past-
and that Iran is only seeking peace and a nuclear-free world. He gave no indication of when Iran would resume talks on
its nuclear program and said any anti-nuclear sanctions against his government would have no effect on his
government's policies. Appearing calm and self-assured, the Iranian president said he was pleased about the release of
American hiker Sarah Shourd from a prison in Tehran, but said her two companions still in prison would have to prove
their innocence on charges that they illegally crossed into the country. &quot;The United States' administrations.., must
recognize that Iran is a big power,&quot; he said. &quot;Having said that, we consider ourselves to be a human force and a cultural
power and hence a friend of other nations. We have never sought to dominate others or to violate the rights of any
other country. &quot;Those who insist on having hostilities with us, kill and destroy the option of friendship of us in the
future, which is unfortunate because it is clear the future belongs to Iran and that enmities will be fruitless- and hence
sanctions, too, will be ineffective.&quot; He added: &quot;If they were to be effective, I should not be sitting here right
now.&quot; Ahmadinejad asserted that international nuclear regulators had never found proof that Iran is pursuing an atomic
bomb. &quot;We are not afraid of nuclear weapons. The point is that if we had in fact wanted to build a nuclear bomb, we
are brave enough to say that we want it. But we never do that. We are saying that the arsenal of nuclear bombs
(worldwide) have to be destroyed as well,&quot; he said. The U.S. accuses Iran of hiding plans to build a nuclear bomb; Iran
denies that and says it's working only toward building nuclear power plants. On the case of the American hikers,
Ahmadinejad said, &quot;We're very glad that that lady was released. (Due) to the humanitarian perspective of the Islamic
Republic chose to adopt on the subject, she was released on bail. And we hope that the other two will soon be able to
prove and provide evidence to the court that they had no ill intention in crossing the border, so that their release can
also be secured.&quot; Tying the case to Iran's assertion that some of its citizens are being held unjustly in the United States,
he said, &quot;It certainly does not give us joy when we see people in prison, wherever in the world that may be, and even
when we think of prisoners here.&quot; His answers were translated from Farsi by an Iranian translator, but Ahmadinejad
appeared to be following the questions in English and occasionally corrected his interpreter. Asked about retired FBI
employee Robert Levinson, who disappeared during a trip to Iran in 2007, Ahmadinejad appeared to suggest that he
may have been Iran for suspicious reasons. &quot;The U.S. government had informed us of this situation and we announced
that we are unaware of it. We agreed to establish a joint information committee to trace... his whereabouts. &quot;Of course
if it becomes clear what his goal was, or if he was indeed on a mission, then perhaps specific assistance can be given,&quot;
the Iranian said. &quot;For example, if he had plans to visit with a group or an individual or go to another country, he would
be easier to trace in that instance.&quot; Levinson was last seen on Iran's Kish island in March 2007 where he had gone to
seek information on cigarette smuggling for a client of his security firm. He had been an FBI agent in New York and
Florida before retiring in 1998. He has not been seen since. Iran says it has no information on him.

Statement by the Secretary
On the Restoration of Democratic and Constitutional Order In Honduras November 27, 2009
The United States remains committed to help restore the democratic and constitutional order in Honduras in the wake
of the June 28 coup d'etat that removed President Zelaya and led to the suspension of Honduras from the Organization
of American States. As part of that effort, it is essential for both parties in Honduras to implement the measures they
agreed to in the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord, including the formation of a government of unity and national
reconciliation and the December 2 congressional vote on President Zelaya&quot;s restitution. These are vital elements of the
Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord, and the Honduran people and the international community expect an expeditious
determination. We look forward to the Congressional deliberations getting underway as announced.
The November 29 national elections are another critical step in the restoration of the democratic and constitutional
order in Honduras. The electoral process -- launched well before June 28 and involving legitimate candidates
representing parties with longstanding democratic traditions from a broad ideological spectrum -- is conducted under
the stewardship of the non-partisan Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which was also selected before the coup. The electoral
renewal of presidential, congressional and mayoral mandates, enshrined in the Honduran constitution, is an inalienable
expression of the sovereign will of the citizens of Honduras. We wish the Honduran people well as they choose their

Subject: Micheletti Stepping Aside
Following is close-hold please.
You will have seen press reports that Micheletti is stepping down — reportedly it will be a &quot;leave of absence&quot; for legal
reasons. If this holds, it is an important development that we have been pushing to allow space for Pepe Lobo to get off
to a good start and encourage greater attendance at the Jan 27 inauguration. This was the point of my Jan 5-6 trip to
Tegucigalpa, Hugo's consistent efforts and our follow-up visa revocations. Two nights ago President Martinelli of
Panama called me saying Micheletti wanted to find a way out and would he, Martinelli, talk to me. I spoke with

    <body>Today a seven hour meeting took place at Downing Street to attempt to determine Gordon's
strategy. The participants were Gordon, Shaun, Peter, Alastair Campbell, and Ed Balls (who is
close to Gordon).
1. Gordon has made a maximum proposal to Clegg through intermediaries, including a
referendum on proportional representation, program, cabinet slots if Clegg wants them, or
not if he prefers to be perceived as above dealmaking. The offer is open, too, and can be
added to. Gordon is letting Cameron and Clegg have their conversation without going
public. Clegg in private is in something of a state of shock. He actually expected to win
about 125 seats—and finished at 57, losing 14 from what the Lib-Dems held. While
Clegg is out front he cannot make a deal on his own; he requires his party's backing.
Gordon and his people are in touch with people close to Clegg. Many of Clegg's senior
people will not support the deal that Cameron has proposed. Vincent Cable, Clegg's
number two, the shadow chancellor, is unhappy with the Tory deal. Clegg is therefore at
sea. Clegg's party base, moreover, would not approve a deal that did not represent a
&quot;progressive&quot; position. Much of the Lib-Dem base is idealistic and subject to
disillusionment.
2. Gordon is doing whatever he can to hold on to power. Shaun, for his part, is working on
an economic package for Northern Ireland to win support from the DUP and other parties
for Labour—a package to be proposed in the Queen's Speech. Peter floats in and out of
the meeting and appears on TV. Alastair has emerged as a stalwart, providing Gordon

Barney Rubin knows him so I asked him to call back on your behalf—here is the feedback no need to call him back. ..
He was calling Cheryl because he wanted to tell the Secretary of State that he has been contacted by tribes and ulama
from both sides of the border. They have proposals for the US strategy and also a message about the interest in peace
of some of the insurgents. I told him that our office handled those issues on behalf of the Secretary of State and that we
would schedule an appointment with him the week after the Karzai visit.

there's jeopardy to the Obama administration's foreign policy if the

Subject: AbZ and Hb3 on Libya and West Bank/Gaza
(SBU) I had back-to-back phone calls this morning from Qatari PM/FM Hamad bin Jassim and UAE Foreign
Minister Abdullah bin Zayed. The content was virtually identical, su esting either rare coincidence or, more
likely, an unusual level of UAE-Qatari coordination at yesterday's Arab League meeting. Main points (mostly
Libya related but one Palestinian-related) are as follows:
(SBU) No-Fly Zone: The Arab League has now called for a NFZ; the UNSC needs to act. Syria was the last hold-
out, but the resolution passed. Time is wasting. Both HbJ and AbZ made the right kind of noises (but still less
than a solid commitment) that there would be some kind of Qatari and Emirati participation in an
international effort. Their chicken-and-egg question to me was, are we going to support a NFZ? If we are,
then we can talk about the other participation.
(SBU) Recognizing the Council: Both urged us to do so. I noted that the Arab League statement fell short of
recognition. They urged us to find some kind of language that would suggest moving in that direction, and I
noted our decisions to suspend the operations of the Libyan Embassy, have S meet with Mahmoud Jibril of the
Council, and send a diplomatic representative to Benghazi. They pushed for more, with HbJ going to far as to
say that recognition of the Council will help underscore to Qadhafi and his circle that he's finished.
(SBU) Jibril meeting: They each said the same thing that Gene Cretz has picked up separately, that Jibril
doesn't want media for his meeting with S unless he feels that there will be something significant out of the
meeting. HbJ is providing a plane for Jibril to get to Paris. HbJ more than AbZ agreed with me that the
meeting itself is a significant deliverable; AbZ urged us not to be slower or quieter than France.
(SBU) West Bank/Gaza: Both reacted negatively to Israeli announcements regarding &quot;hundreds of houses&quot; in
the West Bank. They asked if we were going to say anything; I noted we were still at this point getting the
facts. &quot;Jeff, you guys just aren't serious,&quot; AbZ complained. I noted the political context, in which a family was
brutally murdered.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 25, 2009
STATEMENT FROM THE PRESIDENT REGARDING NORTH KOREA
Today, North Korea said that it has conducted a nuclear test in violation of international law. It appears to also have
attempted a short range missile launch. These actions, while not a surprise given its statements and actions to date, are
a matter of grave concern to all nations. North Korea's attempts to develop nuclear weapons, as well as its ballistic
missile program, constitute a threat to international peace and security.
By acting in blatant defiance of the United Nations Security Council, North Korea is directly and recklessly challenging the
international community. North Korea's behavior increases tensions and undermines stability in Northeast Asia. Such

Gordon was convinced he had to sacrifice himself for any attempt to form a grand progressive coalition with the Lib-Dems.
Clegg had said during the campaign he would not deal with Gordon and he remained adamant. Peter, Alastair, Ed Balls,
and Ed Miliband met secretly with the LD team on Sunday. Gordon decided to fall on his sword today. The negotiations
between Labour and the LDs now are engaged with the same teams. The Tories at the same time also are negotiating.
Both offer competing plans for electoral reform that would give the LDs more representation in the future. If the LDs strike
a deal with the Tories Labour is unlikely to support it and campaign against that referendum. Cameron is strained right

Asif Akhtar, Lahore: Urdu news channel anchors ... succeed in prompting Clinton to declare that far
from being dispatched, the money had only been set aside, and if the Pakistani people didn't want the
money they didn't have to take it. The open-ended question reduced a cackling room to pin-drop
silence, almost embarrassing the anchors for pursuing that line of questioning in the first place. It
seems none of the haughty anchors were ready to make the billion-dollar blunder by ticking off the
Secretary of State and losing all that aid money.
Clinton handled most of the questions and concerns with a calm and a poise people would have
never expected from her predecessor Condaleeza Rice, who would have been more comfortable
carrying out the offensive without the charm.
Given the circumstances, this attempt by a US official at bridging the gap between Pakistani
opinions and US policy is commendable.

    <body>To follow up - the team tried its hand at a boiled down version of the CFR speech, but in 700 words it lost the nuance
and amounted to a series of generalisms. We felt that a more specific topic would allow for a sharper message. We
selected democracy because it allows you to talk about a broad and relevant trend that cuts across global affairs; to
reprise signature themes like Internet freedom, civil society, and the democracy/development nexus; and to underscore
that this administration takes these issues seriously. This was also an element of your CFR speech and provides some
continuity in that respect as well. We were not looking to break new ground but rather to reinforce.

Here's some background: This piece is for a year-ending look-ahead issue of The Economist and we were asked to write
about America's priorities and place in the world in 2011, ten years after 9/11 and twenty years after the end of the Cold
War. The team (Jake, Josh, Anne-Marie, Derek) felt that this was a good opportunity to pull together for a wide audience
some of the key themes you sounded in Krakow and elsewhere, and build on the President's call to action at UNGA. We
don't say anything new here, its true, but the idea was to lay down another marker that these are issues that are
important to you and to the administration.

Issa targets Hillary: Big mistake
By Brent Budowsky - 10/10/12 04:03 PM ET
Don't miss the story in The Hill &quot;Issa closes in on Clinton&quot; about Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) aiming at his
biggest target yet, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The story is correct. The Issa strategy will backfire. It will
prove to be a disaster. House Republicans, whose brand is not exactly soaring with voters, are making a huge
mistake using congressional hearings as a partisan weapon to exploit a national tragedy to attack one of the
most admired and respected public servants in the nation.
There is now an independent and nonpartisan investigation of exactly what happened in Libya. A partisan
witch-hunt by Republicans using taxpayer money against Secretary Clinton, as a partisan weapon in the closing
days of an election, to exploit a tragedy to score political points is exactly what the American people believe
has gone wrong with Washington, and is exactly why the Republican brand is in such disrepute with many
voters.
Many independent voters will be offended. Many female voters will be offended. Many voters tired of their
taxpayer money being wasted for political shenanigans will be offended.

    <body>The political timing on the EU presidency is accelerating. Sarkozy and Merkel are meeting
tonight (October 18) to discuss it. The Czech constitutional court will issue its verdict on the
legality of the Lisbon treaty on November 3. Shortly after, perhaps that week, before you meet
with Merkel on November 8-9, there may be an EU Council meeting to decide the matter. So
you may want to weigh in before then.
Tony is somewhat downcast on his chances. (He met with Jim Hoagland of the Washington Post
yesterday; his mood was described to me.) The Tories have ramped up their campaign against
him—not only do they not want him but they also do not want an effective EU president.

Statement by the Secretary
On the Restoration of Democratic and Constitutional Order In Honduras November 27, 2009
The United States remains committed to help restore the democratic and constitutional order in Honduras in the wake
of the June 28 coup d'etat that removed President Zelaya and led to the suspension of Honduras from the Organization
of American States. As part of that effort, it is essential for both parties in Honduras to implement the measures they
agreed to in the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord, including the formation of a government of unity and national
reconciliation and the December 2 congressional vote on President Zelaya&quot;s restitution. These are vital elements of the
Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord, and the Honduran people and the international community expect an expeditious
determination. We look forward to the Congressional deliberations getting underway as announced.
The November 29 national elections are another critical step in the restoration of the democratic and constitutional
order in Honduras. The electoral process -- launched well before June 28 and involving legitimate candidates
representing parties with longstanding democratic traditions from a broad ideological spectrum -- is conducted under
the stewardship of the non-partisan Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which was also selected before the coup. The electoral
renewal of presidential, congressional and mayoral mandates, enshrined in the Honduran constitution, is an inalienable
expression of the sovereign will of the citizens of Honduras. We wish the Honduran people well as they choose their
new leaders on Sunday, and we urge all sides to exercise their rights peacefully.
The holding of a free, fair and transparent election is necessary but not sufficient for Honduras to reestablish the

I talked to the Libyan Foreign Minister, Musa Kusa, today. He clearly &quot;gets it.&quot; He said that Megrahi would
NOT appear on the September 1 revolution day festivities (40th anniversary of the &quot;green revolution&quot;). And
he said that he totally understood that Qadhafi should stay in New York and not set up a tent in New
Jersey. At the same time, others from the MFA called in our Embassy in Tripoli and called in the UK
ambassador. The Libyans are clearly looking for a way out of the self-inflicted mess. Let's hope that these
wiser heads can prevail on Qadhafi.

Subject: Pls clear: Statement on Conflict Minerals
STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
Conflict Minerals in the Democratic Republic of Congo
Last year in the Democratic Republic of Congo, I spoke out against the trade in &quot;conflict minerals&quot; that has
funded a cycle of conflict there that has left more than 5 million people dead since 1998, displaced countless
more, and spawned an epidemic of sexual and gender-based violence.
President Obama has now signed into law a measure that will require corporations to publicly disclose what
they are doing to ensure that their products don't contain these minerals. The DRC has formally expressed its
support for this law and has thanked both the executive and legislative branches of our government. This is one
of several steps we are taking to stop this illicit and deadly trade.
After my visit to the Congo, I directed the State Department to develop a holistic strategy on this issue as part of
our broader effort to engage effectively with the DRC. We continue to work with the government to crack
down on corruption, both bilaterally and through the Great Lakes Contact Group. At the United Nations
Security Council, we successfully pushed to expand the listing criteria in the DRC Sanctions Committee to
include those supporting illegal armed groups through illicit trade of natural resources. We have provided
support for initiatives on certification and due diligence that have been initiated by the government of the DRC,
local and foreign industry groups, and regional and international institutions. And we have met with a wide
range of industry representatives and discussed the responsibility of end-users to ensure their supply chains are
free of conflict minerals.
All of these steps underscore the commitment of the United States to stand with the people of Congo and to
work toward an end to this conflict.

Subject: Karzai meeting
Dear Melanne and Saba,
I've attached the notes from our meeting with Karzai; they may be helpful in preparing for next week
On the positive side, he committed to including women in any formal negotiations with the Taliban. Hopefully we can nail that down
firmly -- it would be both a good safeguard and a signal to the Taliban of the kind of Afghanistan they will be joining if they do indeed
ever want to join it
Beyond that, he was in &quot;women's lives first, women's rights second&quot; mode — speaking passionately about the human cost of the
conflict and the impossibility of Afghanistan enjoying genuine human rights until the fighting ends. He did this to the point of
denying that any real human rights progress had come in his presidency (thus implying that bringing in Taliban would not make
matters worse).
In terms of your messaging, it would be great if, when the Secretary stresses that reconciling insurgents should accept the Afghan
constitution and laws, she specifically mentions the right of girls to go to school and work and take part in the political process. That
would be consistent, I think, with what the administration has said before, but more explicit. Karzai told us that his government
already stresses those specific rights (that's not true --but it suggests that it would be hard for them to disagree if the US and
international community made it part of their mantra).
It would also, of course, be great if she could find a way to express concern about giving reconciling Taliban leaders who have a track
record of brutality, including attacks on girls schools and killings of women who defy their threats, positions in local or national

The details are also sketchy, but the complaint was apparently filed by an FSO. According to the inquiry that came
in from the press office, apparently alleges that she was the top pick for a position at our Embassy in Algiers, but that she was
denied the position by HR because of her age. This complaint was filed directly in district court; neither S/OCR nor our office have
any record of an administrative complaint being filed.

Isn't a surprise since 5 years ago he removed his brother as official crown prince.
Basically he's not honoring his fathers dying wish but since constitution says it should be son (with brother as option) he
has clear authority to do it. I personally think this shows confidence in his position as he's not worried about an outcry
from his fathers loyalists.

We share your assessment of Pakistan's need for a public narrative and better capacity to communicate effectively.
Judith has been working on how we improve our comm work there, and I know you were talking to the Pakistani
Ambassador about helping them. I'm copying Judith and asking that the two of you discuss what we could do given the
very difficult political landscape.
Thx for all your good counsel. We need to follow thru on the campaign for women we discussed some months back. Are

Mme Secretary:
I'm glad I got to see you at Raj's swearing-in. Hope you liked the speech. Alonzo said we hit the right notes and Raj is off
to a strong start.
Of course I was kidding about &quot;running away&quot; from your &quot;long list&quot; of things you wanted to talk about with me. I'm
happy to talk anytime.
In fact, it would be good to touch base on the women's initiative and Pakistan. I've been talking with NDI's highly
regarded country director in Pakistan, who says communications is a desperate need and will definitely do some good
for the government.
Look forward to seeing you again soon. All the best, Doug

Two things that might be of interest to S: B1
1) I had a long secure call with Senator Mitchell this morning. He will be preparing a written report with
recommendations to convey to her at the beginning of the week. But he's had a difficult series of meetings. I
can brief her if she likes.
2) Henry Kissinger has asked to speak to me this morning. (Not me personally -- the NEA Assistant Secretary;
he doesn't know me from Adam.) Netanyahu is calling him at 10 a.m., so he asked to speak to me at 9
a.m. Kissinger does not know the subject of the Netanyahu call. I talked with Senator Mitchell about this, to
see what might be useful for Kissinger to say to Netanyahu.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Taliban insurgents had planned to use five Americans, now detained in Pakistan, who had
contacted the militants via the Internet, to carry out attacks in the U.S.-allied country, a police official said. Usman
Anwar; police chief in Sargodha, where the men were arrested this month, said emails had revealed plans for the young
men from Virginia to travel to a Pakistani nuclear power plant. &quot;We believe that they were supposed to be used inside
Pakistan,&quot; Anwar told Reuters by telephone. &quot;In their last email to the Taliban, we found they mentioned the Chashma
Nuclear Plant and that's why they were going to Mianwali (district).&quot;

Sydney Morning Herald) Abbas ready for direct talks with Israel
Palestinian President Abbas said he was ready for direct negotiations with Israel, following Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's accusations that the Palestinians are avoiding the talks. &quot;We are ready to hold direct peace negotiations
with Israel,&quot; Abbas told reporters after talks with Jordan's King Abdullah II in Amman. &quot;We have negotiated with Israeli
governments before, more than once. Why would we avoid such talks? We are not.&quot;
Netanyahu told the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs and defense earlier July 26 the Palestinians were trying
to sneak out of direct negotiations while Israel was ready to start them &quot;immediately.&quot; &quot;We have an understanding with
the Americans that we need to move now, without any delay, to direct negotiations, but in response, we have a clear
Palestinian attempt to avoid this process,&quot; Netanyahu said. &quot;They are trying to stall and to sneak away from direct
negotiations and to cause the Arab League to shackle the talks.&quot;

Berlusconi had asked that each donor country &quot;adopt&quot; a damaged cultural heritage monument, but EUR seems to think
that the Italians would welcome the U.S. initiative which might include help in repairing physical damage to the
University itself but would concentrate primarily on development of human capital. One of Ambassador Bagley's
suggestions was that we work with the Italian Ambassador here, who is well connected to the Prime Minister, to ensure
a positive Italian response.

Cheryl,
Ambassador Bagley and Kris joined representatives from EUR and ECA today to review where things stand with
respect to launching a public/private partnership in response to PM Berlusconi's appeal to the President. EUR and ECA
will be sending up today a follow-up action memo to the Secretary asking that she approve in principle a partnership in
conjunction with the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF) that would focus largely on raising money for
academic exchanges for students from L'Aquila University, the school of higher education most affected by the
earthquake. This is not exactly the monument rebuilding that PM Berlusconi initially proposed, but it is something very
much in keeping with our mission and of interest to NIAF. Ambassador Bagley and Kris had a number of suggestions that
will help EUR and ECA as we move forward especially in selecting the right people to help with fund raising and making
sure the Italian Government welcomes this initiative. Dan

Subject: From Arturo - Correa Rescued in Ecuador
Madame Secretary: After a tense day in which President Correa was slightly injured at noon by rioting and striking
police, and later was barred from leaving the hospital by the same, the army finally rescued him at 9pm last night. Some
military units, including the Navy unit in Guayaquil appeared to support the police. The police also occupied the national
congress. As the rescue took place, the head of the Ecuadoran Joints Chiefs of Staff issued a statement supporting the
president, and noting that the armed forces respect the rule of law &quot;in which the President [Rafael Correa] is the
maximum authority of the three branches.&quot; Things are now calm.
Reaction in the hemisphere was one of deep concern. The OAS adopted a resolution; South American presidents at the
call of UNASUR travelled to Buenos Aires and are likely to go on to Quito to support Correa. Several, including Garcia
and Santos, called Correa. Zapatero also spoke with him. Moratinos tried to reach you at around 6pm last evening to
convey that news, I took the call.
As you know, we issued a statement of support for Correa. I also gave an interview to CNN in Spanish, which was re-
played frequently. I strongly recommend that you call Correa today to reiterate U.S. support for his government and to
wish him well.
He will appreciate it but, more broadly, it sends a signal that the United States supports the constitutional order and

Cheryl,
I just spoke with Vidal Jorgensen. They expect to be on the ground in about 8 months. They have not yet raised enough
money to get the project started—the total needed is $6M and they need $2M to get started. Vidal said they process
has been delayed because their work in Colombia and China is consuming all their resources at the moment. Once on
the ground, they will target the poorest of the poor and go to the toughest areas of Haiti. They anticipate an average
loan size of $200 and they expect to reach about 10,000 borrowers in five years. They expect to be profitable in 4-5
years.

    <body>Joint Statement by Former President Clinton and Secretary of State Clinton on the Passing of Dr. Dorothy Height We are
deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Dr. Dorothy Height, an icon of America's long march toward equality and a
personal inspiration to us both. As the only woman among the &quot;Big Six&quot; civil rights leaders, Dr. Height helped galvanize a
movement that changed our country forever. She organized the &quot;Wednesdays in Mississippi&quot; meetings that brought
black and white women together to find common ground and break down barriers. She never stopped fighting for what
she knew was right. And through it all, she was always the best dressed woman in the room. We were blessed to know
Dr. Height, to benefit from her grace, passion and wisdom, and to call her our friend. For decades, starting with the early
days at the Children's Defense Fund, we worked with her, learned from her, and drew inspiration from her example.
From the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to the Congressional Gold Medal, to the unveiling of a long-sought-after bust
of Sojourner Truth in the United States Capitol, we had the privilege of helping honor Dr. Height and her
accomplishments. Born before women had the right to vote, denied access to the college of her choice because of the

We may have to vote on a motion to *deny* them credentials and exclude them. For the moment, the guidance is to

Subject: (AP) Thousands flee ethnic riots in Kyrgyzstan; Russia sends troops to base
BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan (AP) - As minority Uzbeks flee the Central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan by the thousands, Russia is
sending in a battalion of paratroopers to protect its air base in the country. More than 100 people have been killed and
about 1250 wounded in four days of ethnic violence spreading across southern Kyrgyzstan. Doctors and rights activists
say the actual toll is likely far higher than that official count, because wounded Uzbeks are too afraid of being attacked
again to go to hospitals. Mobs of ethnic Kyrgyz have been reportedly torching Uzbek villages and neighborhoods,
slaughtering residents. Authorities in Uzbekistan says more than 75,000 refugees have fled its neighbor. Most are said
to be women, children and the elderly, and many have gunshot wounds. While the Kremlin has refused Kyrgyzstan's
request for military help quelling the violence, the Interfax news agency reports Russia has sent about 300 paratroopers

    <body>Eco.docx- 25Nov2010.doc
This is a very thoughtful piece that identifies many of the same factors we are in our diplomatic chapter (and that is not
just because the author – the former Bangladesh ambassador to the US—cites me). What is most striking is that it
affirms that our analysis in the QDDR offers a set of questions that foreign ministries all over the world are grappling
with. I had hoped to have time to do some traveling to broadcast the QDDR to key allies and partners around the world
after the QDDR is in, but even if that can't happen, we will devise an outreach strategy re sending the report out to
foreign ministers around the world and to our ambassadors that will greatly amplify its impact. AM

Subject: Honduras Update Sat 10:00 pm EST
To All:
The de facto authorities' consultations continued today -- with government agencies, Congress and judicial branch. The
meetings just wrapped up. Our sources tell us the process is moving forward and will result in a series of measures
Mon-Wed: some govt resignations and replacements; possible announcement of Dec 2 or 3 for Congressional action on
Z issue; M &quot;step aside.&quot; We have reiterated that latter is crucial for our diplomacy to boost election support.
The de factos say the M speech announcing that is being drafted.
De facto negotiators say the military played a useful role today in pushing the process forward.
Amb Llorens notes that while the de facto consultations may look like a stall, the tendency to seek this sort of buy-in is
one reason Honduras historically has been more peaceful than its neighors.
While our role on the most sensitive issue is not known outside of very few people, the impression is growing in the
country and among careful observers in region that something is happening. Insulza told Arturo today that he wants to
find a pragmatic way forward and could use a fig leaf. We hope to produce something more than that. Z's negotiators

1. Well get you a new CGI draft tomorrow morning for you to noodle on. Feel free to'call when you've looked at it
and we can talk about other directions if it doesn't feel right.
2, Tom met with Barak today; I will get readout from Sam V tomorrow afternoon. Wendy is going to write points
for you.
3. Yousef called to say now that Jeff is gone ABZ has no one to talk to on a regular basis and asked if he could talk
to Bill Burns.
4. Ben Rhodes sent me the draft UNGA speech which I will forward to you shortly.
5. Bill/Wendy are currently in a SVTC on some information that they may want to report to you on — but unclear
whether there is anything to it.
6. We've nailed down a $15 mm non-lethal support and $15 mm humanitarian support announcement for next
Friday's Friends of Syria meeting.
7. Hold on Rick Olson was lifted by Paul.
8. Protestors stormed Ansar al Shade's headquarters in Benghazi, and a huge number marched against militias.
9. 1 saw Dennis Ross today for one of our S/P sessions. I can fill you in on the latest on his effort. Also, he will send
you some stuff in advance of your relevant meetings (he was just in Israel).
That's the key stuff for now. More medium-range stuff to discuss in NY.

He has been incorporating fine-tuning edits today. I will email you a draft shortly, which will be tweaked

On your book, I understand that Huma will bring it out in the morning.

Also, I just saw on the schedule I was expected to speak for only 12 minutes. I think the speech as written is longer but I

I also don't yet have any briefing materials. Will I get them tonight or tomorrow morning?

Heads up -- A friend just sent this to me. Does anyone have any intel? This is a huge step and kudos to Sec. Clinton for
expending the political capital to be the first federal agency to do this!
FYI. Berman just spoke about it.
•Enact two items sought by the Foreign Service: elimination of a rule that inadvertently reduces the pay of officers
serving overseas by as much as 20 percent, and extension to same-sex partners of the benefits given to spouses and
their families, such as access to U.S. health care and moving expenses. This last provision is likely to provoke GOP
objections.
I don't have the source my friend used, but hopefully some of you might. If this is true (which I hope it is), we have to
start gearing up for the battle to support her now!

Had a good meeting with Holbrooke and team today. He was very nice and wanted me to let the Secretary know he was
cooperating well with me. (thanks for that!) We are focused on the S trip and equally focused on a credible plan that can
be explained on the Hill and will be sustainable. I am on board to lead an energy policy dialogue in Pakistan on 10-20/21
but we will have a package ready for S much sooner of course.

I have not been able to get a psychology dinner set up, but I have found the article that you read on
the difference an apology can make in the Middle East (coming in next email) and commissioned a
useful paper from Louise Diamond, an expert on psychology and negotiations who has done a lot
of work between the Israels and the Palestinians herself (attached). It's about 5 pages; I really think
it is worth a read. Finally, on changing the frame to look forward, I strongly recommend that you
spend 8 minutes to look at a video produced by a Rand study called The Arc, which proposes a
high-speed road/rail project connecting the key cities in the West Bank and Gaza. It is a powerful,
powerful vision of what could be, one that will play right into Bibi's emphasis on economic growth.
For my money, it would be worth a private 8 minutes screening. I will send the link in the next

Oh, actually the problem you are having is that it needs to find WiFi - do you have WiFi in whatever home you're in now?
We just need to set that up once and it will subsequently connect whenever it senses that wifi.
And yes on Monday can spend some quality time.

Dear Hillary and all.
We arrived at the general hospital last night with 1500 people sick or dying with 40 percent needing surgery. It has no
water electricity or food and very limited surgical suites or supplies It the largest and most well known public hospital in
the city and according to PIH and paul farmer needs to be supported and it's infrastucture needs to be rebuilt.
Right now we have surgeons but not enough operating rooms set up. We
desperately need to get a generator and fuel and surgical lights and surgery supplies not just first aid. There are
hundreds including children with festering wounds needing amputation and emergency
surgical care. The doctors nurses and patients have no food or water.
Can you help get the infrastructure of electricity water and a medical hospital tent for post op patients. We are
operating with headlamps and hacksaws rinsed with alcohol.
If we have the electricity and water we can open 11 operating rooms tomorrow if we get what we need. Can the
military help ASAP and for security of equipment and medication.
Until this morning when id the first amuptation there was almost no surgery happening at all here in the city and
none at the General.
Five days after the quake with no acute surgical care wounds are

he injured DS officer he is now well enough to talk he doesnt want a visit but a check in call and asking him if
he needs anything would be good monica will remind you of this
Also heard from both the bush and reagan libraries over the last few days neither wants to host the osc.ar exhibit after it

The plan is to have a large screen off to your side so that it won't get in the way of a tight shot. We've worked with
National Geographic on the photos -- some of which are quite stunning -- and they'll pace the presentation slowly with

JERUSALEM - (AP) Israel's premier has ordered an investigation into how government officials announced plans for a
new Jewish housing project in east Jerusalem during a visit by Vice President Joe Biden. Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's office said he ordered the probe late Saturday after he met with top Cabinet ministers. While Biden was
visiting earlier this week, Israel's Interior Ministry said it approved plans to build 1,600 homes for Jews in disputed east
Jerusalem. Biden condemned the announcement, which overshadowed his visit. Netanyahu has apologized for the poor
timing of the announcement, but given no sign he will cancel the construction orders. The Palestinians claim east

Heads up -- A friend just sent this to me. Does anyone have any intel? This is a huge step and kudos to Sec. Clinton for
expending the political capital to be the first federal agency to do this!
FYI. Berman just spoke about it.
•Enact two items sought by the Foreign Service: elimination of a rule that inadvertently reduces the pay of officers
serving overseas by as much as 20 percent, and extension to same-sex partners of the benefits given to spouses and
their families, such as access to U.S. health care and moving expenses. This last provision is likely to provoke GOP
objections.
I don't have the source my friend used, but hopefully some of you might. If this is true (which I hope it is), we have to
start gearing up for the battle to support her now!

Africa use TRS to elect their presidents. Elsewhere in Africa the system is used by Angola, Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana,
Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, S5o Tome and Principe, the Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Sudan,
Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe; in Europe, apart from France, it is used by Armenia, Azerbaijan, Austria, Belarus,

The political timing on the EU presidency is accelerating. Sarkozy and Merkel are meeting tonight (October 18) to discuss
it. The Czech constitutional court will issue its verdict on the legality of the Lisbon treaty on November 3. Shortly after,
perhaps that week, before you meet with Merkel on November 8-9, there may be an EU Council meeting to decide the
matter. So you may want to weigh in before then.

US Senators blast 'dysfunctional' diplomats in Afghanistan
WASHINGTON, June 23, 2010 (AFP) - President Barack Obama must overhaul the &quot;completely
dysfunctional&quot; civilian side of US-led efforts in Afghanistan or risk losing the high-
stakes conflict, three hawkish US Senators said Wednesday.
Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, joined by Independent Senator Joe
Lieberman, stopped just shy of explicitly urging Obama to replace Ambassador Karl
Eikenberry but had harsh words for US diplomacy in Kabul.
&quot;The civilian side is, in my view, completely dysfunctional. The relationship between the
civilian leadership and (Afghan) President (Hamid) Karzai has to be changed and
repaired,&quot; said Graham.
&quot;I would urge the president to look at this as a chance to put new people on the ground
without old baggage. And if we don't change quickly, we're going to lose a war we can't
afford to lose,&quot; warned Graham.
Graham and his colleagues warmly praised Obama's decision to replace General Stanley
McChrystal with General David Petraeus, but cautioned that diplomatic failures could
hamstring his efforts to manage the increasingly unpopular war.
McCain suggested that Obama bring back veteran diplomat Ryan Crocker, who was ambassador
to Baghdad when he and Petraeus enacted the &quot;surge&quot; strategy credited in Washington with
bringing Iraq back from the brink of civil war.
&quot;We might suggest that a consideration be given to reuniting the Crocker-Petraeus team,
although I'm sure that Ambassador Crocker will never forgive me for saying that, since
he's enjoying his retirement,&quot; McCain said with a chuckle.
&quot;There is discontent -- or let me say, there is a lack of coordination and teamwork --
between the military and civilian side, both at the embassy and other areas, in
Afghanistan that needs to be repaired,&quot; said McCain.
Lieberman took a slightly softer line, but underlined he felt &quot;there is not the kind of
unity in Afghanistan between our civilian and military leadership&quot; that is needed to
prosecute Obama's counterinsurgency strategy.
The senators sharply criticized McChrystal over a Rolling Stone magazine profile in which
the general and his aides are quoted as mocking top Obama national security aides, from

    <body>Pakistanis to move them to more aggressively pursue AQ. I've thought about it some more and,
while I have no silver bullet, here are some further thoughts.
-- My impression is that the Pakistanis have been more cooperative lately in assisting us target some
AQ in Pakistan and that, where they hold back, it is less a function of affinity toward AQ and more
about with whom AQ is imbedded..
-- In particular, they seem to be more reluctant to target AQ where it is nestled with groups they want
to cultivate in the event we &quot;leave&quot; Afghanistan and they need influence there. They have seen that
before and will hedge their bets.
-- So the first point is that we have to address the reason why they are holding back. If we can
disabuse them of the perception that we are leaving Afghanistan, it will be easier to get the Pakistanis
to go after AQ in sanctuaries provided by groups which would be part of a future Afghanistan
dominated by the Taliban.
-- Second, I believe that coercive measures are more likely to be effective if they are targeted against
military leaders who give support to AQ and its allies. Assuming we have adequate intelligence, we
can go after bank accounts, travel and other reachable assets of individual Pakistani officers, raising
the stakes for those supporting the militants without creating an inordinate backlash . Blunter
measures of coercion, like conditioning our assistance, are more likely to be counterproductive. Given
the level of distrust for us among the Pakistani people, they would see this as another sharp swing of
the U.S. pendulum which would harden their attitudes and make greater cooperation very difficult for
the Pakistani people to accept.
-- There may be greater leverage in giving the Pakistanis incentives to be more aggressive. Of
course, the military's calculation is most important. I'm not sure what is on their shopping list these
days but we would need to balance what would move the needle on AQ against undercutting our
effort to get them to shift their strategic focus away from India. . At the same time, we can be as
forward leaning as possible in support of their counterinsurgency capabilities (equipment, training,
whatever material, intelligence and other assistance we can give them if they move into Wazeristan --
including relief for displaced persons). If they finally take that step, we can do all that is possible to
demonstrate that our arrows are aligned with theirs..
-- On the civilian side, their desire for greater control over how Kerry-Lugar money can be used can
be played to our strategic advantage. If we give them a greater sense that they are directing the use
of these funds -- without greatly undercutting their effectiveness -- it strengthens our position to press
them on AQ.
-- Finally, there is the defining relationship with India. Are there measures that the Indians could take
that would reduce Pakistani anxieties about the Indian front and thus better enable them to focus on
threats to the East, including both AQ and anti-Indian militant groups like LET? Are there confidence

UNAMA MANDATE RENEWAL &amp; RUSSIAN DISCUSSION
On March 22 the Security Council renewed the UNAMA mandate by unanimous consent, but not without a short delay
at the request of Russian PermRep Churkin, who called for last-minute consultations prior to the adoption of the
mandate. Churkin took the floor in closed consultations to &quot;begin an interactive dialogue&quot; highlighting the drug problem
caused by Afghanistan's unabated poppy cultivation, noting it fuels domestic corruption and finances the Taliban.
Churkin's &quot;dialogue&quot; was triggered by a front-page Sunday New York Times article titled, &quot;U.S. Turns a Blind Eye to

Re: Brookings
Sorry,
just seeing this.
Sanger has a blog item on the NYT site about the comment, but more of a political take in that if you run for president
again your opponents will pull the Brookings tape. And a couple of wingnut blogs asking why you don't just volunteer
more of your own money to taxes, and that you chose Brazil as a &quot;socialist country that sides with our enemies as a
model.&quot;. But frankly, I had to look pretty hard to find that, I was the 19th person to read it. Not 19,000th. 19th.
Most coverage was either straightforward about the NSS, or your comments about the debt as a national security
problem.
But feedback I got was strong, people always always always love you in that format.

Re: Oil spill
I'm not
For a few reasons
First, calmness is not such a bad thing in these moments. Calm is not cavalier, which you weren't
Second, you're not the EPA administrator or Interior Secretary - nobody will see you as a front line cabinet officer on this
Third, if this is still out of control on Sunday, the administration has bigger problems
So I'm really not worried.
Here it is again which might allay your concerns
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, David, I think that the President has ordered the departments that deal with this —
Homeland Security, Interior, Environmental Protection, Defense — to all immediately not only do everything possible to
mitigate the effects of this spill, but to try to come up with recommendations going forward. The first order of business,
however, is to try to get this spill under control, which has been, as you know, very difficult, and to prevent further
damage to the coastline along Louisiana to the fishing waters, to the wildlife. I think it does raise questions which the
President has said have to be answered. He put forth a very comprehensive approach that included the potential of
drilling off of our own shores. That is a national security concern because we have to do better to lessen our
dependence on foreign oil. But it has to be done safely. It can't be done at the risk of having to spend billions of dollars
cleaning up these spills. So as with so much in these difficult areas, it's going to require a balancing act.

Madame Secretary: After a tense day in which President Correa was slightly injured at noon by rioting and
striking police, and later was barred from leaving the hospital by the same, the army finally rescued him at
9pm last night. Some military units, including the Navy unit in Guayaquil appeared to support the police. The
police also occupied the national congress. As the rescue took place, the head of the Ecuadoran Joints Chiefs
of Staff issued a statement supporting the president, and noting that the armed forces respect the rule of law
&quot;in which the President [Rafael Correa] is the maximum authority of the three branches.&quot; Things are now
calm.
Reaction in the hemisphere was one of deep concern. The OAS adopted a resolution; South American
presidents at the call of UNASUR travelled to Buenos Aires and are likely to go on to Quito to support
Correa. Several, including Garcia and Santos, called Correa. Zapatero also spoke with him. Moratinos tried to
reach you at around 6pm last evening to convey that news, I took the call.
As you know, we issued a statement of support for Correa. I also gave an interview to CNN in Spanish, which

    <body>Senate Republicans Filibuster Fair Pay For Women
Matt Finkelstein
The first bill President Obama signed after taking office was the Lilly
Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which made it easier for women to seek justice for
pay discrimination. At the time, Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), Kay Bailey
Hutchison (R-TX) and Olympia Snowe (R-ME) joined with Democrats to
overcome strong Republican opposition to the bill.
But today, all three Republican senators voted against a motion to
proceed on the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill that &quot;would further
strengthen current laws against gender-based wage discrimination.&quot; The
motion was defeated by a vote of 58-41, falling two votes short of the 60
needed for the bill to be considered on the Senate floor.
This is not the first time the Paycheck Fairness Act has stalled in the
Senate. In 2008, the upper chamber failed to vote on the bill after it was
approved by the House, which passed the legislation again in 2009 with
the support of 10 Republicans.

    <body>Subject From the road
(wanted to give you some brief observations from my trip to Lithuania. First of all, their friendship with the US and
respect for you was much in evidence on all levels. Most of the cabinet turned out for the reception that the amb hosted
for me. The FM went out his way to tell me what it meant to get a call from you when he assumed his position (he's
hoping to have a few mins with you in Tallin). As far as Lith has to go, it has achieved some remarkable achievements for
Eastern Eur. They have a female president, Speaker, Finance minister and def. minister. I had a good meeting with the
President and thanked her for Lith commitment to our collective efforts in afghanistan. They run the smallest PRT and,
despite a tough economy, have done everything we've asked in terms of additional support since the surge. The meeting
with the Speaker and top women members of the parl'nt was yet another reminder of your inspiration over many years.
One of the women was at the Vienna W conf and said she's in politics today because of you. Another read about safe
birthing kits in your book and was inspired to send several thousand to Afghanistan. They are eager for more
opportunities to work together.
I came primarily to launch the new working group on gender that we and Lith are co-chairing. There was much gratitude
for our leadership with them in the Community of Democracies.
The meaning of democracy is so strong for people who had to stuggle for it more recently. They really feel this is an
important time to renew the understanding of democ, particularly after the bruising it underwent over the last several
years.
We had terrific turnout from other countries, many comments about you and references to Beijing and Iceland W conf.
(So many people told me the impact Vienna and Iceland had on them). We left our meeting with many commitments for
future concrete projects that will be undertaken. There is great hope that you will be in Krakow in July for the CD
ministerial. The Lith CD coordinator headed to Belgium the next day for an EU meeting. He told me he got a very positive
response for our gender initiative and that Ashton was particularly excited about it. The EU is locating their new gender
institute in Lithuania and they are ager for our help.

Subject: RE: Honduran President Zelaya Reportedly Seized by Armed Forces
I am in the office and working with our Embassy in Tegucigalpa. Apparently, the action this morning was a coordinated
effort by the Supreme Court, the Honduran Congress, and the armed forces to prevent President Zelaya from holding a
non-binding poll on a possible constituent assembly. The Supreme Court determined the poll illegal and ordered the
military to collect all balloting materials. In the process of doing this, the military also seized Zelaya and supposedly sent
him by aircraft to Costa Rica.
Our Ambassador has his Emergency Action Committee convened at the Embassy. They are reaching out to all their
contacts to determine the current state of play. The Embassy will issue a warden message soon to U.S. citizens in
Honduras regarding events. I have called our Embassy in Costa Rica and asked it to confirm Zelaya's presence in San
Jose. I will be calling the Costa Rican Foreign Minister soon. Tomorrow, Costa Rica takes over as President Pro Temp of
the Central American Integration System.
Hector Morales has been in touch with OAS SecGen Insulza. The OAS Permanent Council passed a resolution on Friday
offering its good offices to Honduras to resolve the political impasse, and Insulza was going to lead a team to Honduras
on Monday. We are checking to determine the state of play of the delegation, but OAS involvement will be key to a
successful resolution of this event.
I will also be calling the new SouthCom Commander to ensure a coordinated U.S. approach. We have big military
equities in Honduras through Joint Task Force Bravo at Soto Cano airbase.
We are working up press points now. Although this morning's events were part of a larger political and institutional
struggle in Honduras. The seizure and expulsion of the President was an intolerable act by the armed forces and we are
going to have to say this loud and clear.

Just saw the email from Sid - was working on the below report. Shaun apparently had a much
more pessimistic view of what Cameron would do than all of our Parliament watchers, who felt
confident from the get-go that he would support the deal.
PM Brown praised all parties involved; stressed the need to adhere to the dates laid out in
the agreement several times; welcomed the supportive Westminster interventions during the Q
and A of SDLP Mark Durkan and DUP Peter Robinson and Nigel Dods, but pointedly expressed hope
that other parties (read UUP, whose MP was either not present or simply didn't speak) would
express their support as soon as possible.
As expected, David Cameron praised the agreement and all parties; raised the desire that all
parties (read SDLP and UUP) be given time to review the document; and pointedly asked the PM
what issues that were not expressly mentioned in the agreement would be addressed by the
Working Group -- to which Brown responded, &quot;all the issues outstanding from St Andrew's.&quot;
Cameron and Brown praised the U.S. role, singling you out. Brown also twice referred to your
offer to host an investment conference.
Overall, nothing concerning from the Tories...on the contrary, full support, a request that

The Secretary's Call Sheet for
Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari
Purpose of Call: To express your condolences regarding the deaths of Iraqi MFA personnel in the August 19 attack on
the Iraqi Foreign Ministry.
MI want to personally express my heartfelt condolences to you for the savage attack on the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign
Affairs today and for the tragic loss of so many Iraqi lives around Baghdad and particularly at the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.
al I remember fondly our meeting at the MFA in April — I was proud to be the first senior U.S. official to attend a meeting
there, and I was deeply saddened to hear that your Ministry was attacked.
DI This is a trying day for Iraqis and the Government of Iraq, but brutal attacks like these only deepen the need for
dedicated Iraqi like you and those in your Ministry, to remain committed to the new Iraq.
1:11 Know that the United States will continue to stand by Iraq as it faces these challenges.
Background: On Wednesday, August 19, what appears to be a series of VBIED and additional rocket attacks in Baghdad
resulted in the bloodiest day in Baghdad since the June 30 withdrawal of U.S. forces from urban areas. Although exact
numbers have not been confirmed, media is reporting that approximately 75 people were killed across Baghdad with
over 100 injuries. The most devastating attack appears to have been against the Iraqi MFA, where a VBIED was

At the conclusion of yesterday's meeting, the Palau delegation caucused to discuss its reaction to the response of the United
States delegation to the proposals that it made in June in Washington D.C., and expanded upon in subsequent communications.
While the Palau delegation has agreed to respond to certain additional questions raised by the United States delegation on specific
elements of the Palau proposal, and further has agreed to participate in certain working groups on specific issues, the Palau
delegation was deeply disappointed with the response of the United States delegation. The United States delegation did not

Subject: Meeting with Honduran de factos
To All:
We spent about 90 minutes with the four de facto representatives. I invited them to make their points first
(they often complain that people don't listen to them). They focused on the abuses Zelaya committed before
June 28, pointing out that the San Jose Accord, while'key to a solution, would not restore the institutional
damage done to Honduras.
I said that clearly the San Jose Accords were necessary but not sufficient to clean up all the broken crockery in
Honduras. But they ARE necessary — and urgent. Only by implementing the agreement can Hondurans repair
the other damage with the support of the international community — which is essential for the country's
success. I then reviewed all the carrots and sticks we discussed this morning. I cited the Secretary in
underscoring urgency. Other countries join us, I emphasized, in seeing the mixed messages coming out of
Tegucigalpa as a deliberate delaying tactic designed to move the country toward elections without
Zelaya. The United States and others are losing patience with these tactics and want to see solid commitment
to the Accord now.
The de factos acknowledged that the world perceives them as delaying and that they need to move quickly. I
said they should commit publicly to the San Jose Accord when the OAS FMs are in Honduras next week. They
said that made sense.
Then they brought up another issue. The San Jose Accord grants political amnesty but not amnesty for other
crimes. They can arrest Z for corruption as soon as he returns to the country. I pushed back hard, saying no
one — Arias, the OAS, the United States — understands the San Jose Accord as leading to Z's immediate
arrest. The understanding is that he would resume limited functions with a national unity cabinet until he
hands over power to an elected successor. To say they will arrest Z is to ensure that he does not return, and
thus the collapse of the Arias plan. They seemed to back off slightly, but this remains a problem.
We are working already with other FMs and with Arias to make sure the de factos know this is a non-starter. I
plan to call the de facto delegation chief back Wednesday to cite my conversations tonight with others in the

Subject: Pinera-Insulza
See the report below: Pinera has announced his support.
I had a long conversation with Craig a little while ago. He spoke with a number of people in Chile, including his close
friend,
According to Craig, Pinera had made the calculation that it would be politically untenable to dump Insulza. Apparently
there is a coalition leadership in the lower house, and Insulza's party, Concertacion, controls the upper house. So he had
no choice.
That said, Craig believes that his clear message had an impact on what Pinera told Insulza. He apparently gave his
support with two conditions: (1) don't interfere in Chilean politics, and (2) take the democratization agenda seriously
and don't carry the ALBA countries' water.
Craig also said that Arturo had been effective in making clear that the jury was out on Insulza in Washington -- that had
an impact on the Pinera government and reinforced their second message to him.
Bottom line: Craig said we couldn't have talked Pinera off of this, but we helped drive a stronger set of conditions on
Pinera's support.

I've spent the last five years testing ideas and concepts to see how the development issue is understood by Americans
and what are the challenges. I care deeply about this, I got into politics because I was frustrated by how little I could help
living in a refugee camp on the Ethiopian-Somali border. The substantive policies obviously matter most, we got some
right and some wrong in Clinton years, but the results of our bipartisan research may be useful. Here's my super-concise
private summary:
1. The goal is help people be able to help themselves. The size of the program is important to advocates, but Americans
want to know the ultimate goal is to be helping people be able to care for themselves (like grow enough food for Africa).
2.We all agree that kids should be a key focus and the best reason for any program is the moral importance. It's fine to
acknowledge we do these programs for a variety of pragmatic reasons, but the most powerful reason is moral. It is the
right thing to do.
3.We mostly all agree it is ok to spend money on these programs, but we should always note how we are fighting for
reform too. The two concepts are not antagonists, but partners. And we are partners with other countries, this is not hand

Dear Under Secretary McHale,
Attached please find the latest Opinion Analysis on West European views of U.S. assistance to Haiti. A synopsis follows:
Western Europe: Publics Credit U.S. for Relief to Haiti
Britons, French, Germans, Italians, and Spaniards say the United States has done more than other countries to
assist Haiti following the devastating January earthquake. Though relief efforts in Haiti have not themselves directly
impacted opinion of the United States, the belief that the United States generally assists disaster-stricken countries
does positively affect US. image.

Hi there,
Wow, just re-read my response to you and it's unintelligible--my apologies. I type so quickly on my
Blackberry and don't proof read which I later regret.
Secretary Clinton was wonderful and so gracious to do the interview during her much needed vacation. I have
covered many of the issues that we discussed and feel so passionately about them as well.
If I can ever help with anything, please don't hesitate to let me know. I'm so delighted that Secretary Clinton is
spearheading so many vital efforts to help women around the world.
Best regards,

LONDON (Reuters) — U.S. General David Petraeus, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, said NATO-
led forces had facilitated the passage of a senior Taliban commander to Kabul to hold talks with the Afghan
government. Speaking to an audience in London, Petraeus said the move was part of U.S. and NATO support for Afghan
President Hamid Karzai's reconciliation discussions with the Taliban. &quot;In certain respect we do facilitate that, given that,
needless to say it would not be the easiest of tasks for a senior Taliban commander to enter Afghanistan and make his
way to Kabul if ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) were not....aware of it and therefore allows it to take
place,&quot; he said. &quot;That's about as far as I can go on that at this point.&quot;

At the close of the 30 hours (or when they yield back) we are back on START. We were able to convince Reid this
morning not to file cloture on the treaty, which would have played in to Kyl's hands. So we are likely to have one full
more day of debate and some votes on amendments, then file cloture setting up a cloture vote early next week. Mccain
and Graham are still in a grumpy place - Graham is worse than McCain and we may have lost him. But McCain is still

Dear Hillary and all.
We arrived at the general hospital last night with 1500 people sick or dying with 40 percent needing surgery. It has no
water electricity or food and very limited surgical suites or supplies It the largest and most well known public hospital in
the city and according to NH and paul farmer needs to be supported and it's infrastucture needs to be rebuilt.
Right now we have surgeons but not enough operating rooms set up. We
desperately need to get a generator and fuel and surgical lights and surgery supplies not just first aid. There are
hundreds including children with festering wounds needing amputation and emergency
surgical care. The doctors nurses and patients have no food or water.
Can you help get the infrastructure of electricity water and a medical hospital tent for post op patients. We are
operating with headlamps and hacksaws rinsed with alcohol.
If we have the electricity and water we can open 11 operating rooms tomorrow if we get what we need. Can the
military help ASAP and for security of equipment and medication.
Until this morning when did the first amuptation there was almost no surgery happening at all here in the city and B6
none at the General.
Five days after the quake with no acute surgical care wounds are
festering patients are getting septic and dying. If we had a little
help with basic servcices we could stop this.

Angola pledges $1.2 bin to farming, food security
LUANDA (Reuters) - Angola will invest an estimated $1.2 billion in agricultural development over
the next four years as part of a food security initiative, according to a government statement
published on Thursday.
The investment will be financed by a line of credit from the China Development Bank, private
investment and other loans, said the statement in the state-owned newspaper Jornal de Angola.
The plan is to take advantage of Angola's natural resources and bolster employment, the
government said. Angola was once a major food exporter but a 27-year civil war that ended in
2002 devastated the sector.
&quot;The project also aims to guarantee food security, supply the internal market and take
advantage of local, regional and international 'opportunities,&quot; the statement said.

Incidentally, unbidden by me on both points-i.e., volunteering-he went out of his way to says upbeat things about you

Iran
We are concerned about the aftermath of Iranian Presidential elections. We fully respect the sovereignty of Iran. At the
same time, we deplore post-electoral violence, which led to the loss of lives of Iranian civilians. We express our solidarity
with those who have suffered repression while peacefully demonstrating and urge Iran to respect fundamental human
rights, including freedom of expression, as ensured by the international treaties it has ratified. The crisis should be
settled soon through democratic dialogue and peaceful means on the basis of the rule of law. We call on the Iranian
government to guarantee that the will of the Iranian people is reflected in the electoral process.
We remain committed to finding a diplomatic solution to the issue of Iran's nuclear program and support renewed
efforts to that effect, such as the readiness of the U.S. to enter into direct talks and the invitation from China, France,
Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States to Iran to restart negotiations, as well as the constructive
involvement of other G8 partners in the process. We stress the need for unity of action on the basis of agreed policy. We
sincerely hope that Iran will seize this opportunity to give diplomacy a chance to find a negotiated solution to the

    <body>ill Ex-Gates Foundation exec named foreign aid chief
Obama administration picks former Gates Foundation official to run US foreign aid
By MATTHEW LEE
Associated Press
ij 11-10-2009 13:46
11 SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Obama administration will nominate a young former executive with the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation to run America's top foreign assistance program, ending months of speculation
and complaints about who would take the vacant post, U.S. officials said Tuesday.
$ President Barack Obama has chosen Rajiv Shah, a medical doctor and currently a senior official at the
Department of Agriculture dealing with food security, to run the U.S. Agency for International
Development, the officials said.
¶ The officials spoke on condition of anonymity pending notification to Congress and a formal public
announcement of the choice.
11 Shah's selection, which must still be confirmed by the Senate, would end a 10-month leadership
vacuum at USAID, which has been operating with an acting director since Obama took office despite his
campaign pledges to have the agency play a greater role in foreign policy.
11 Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton have said USAID is crucial to deploying their
preferred &quot;smart power&quot; foreign policy strategy, which envisions more equal roles for diplomacy and
development alongside defense. They plan to double the amount of foreign aid.
11 The agency will play a key role in the administration's efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where
officials believe the civilian component must be strengthened.
$ But the top job at the agency has remained vacant until now, with several prime candidates'
withdrawing from consideration amid a White House vetting process that Clinton denounced in July as
&quot;ridiculous,&quot; &quot;a nightmare,&quot; and &quot;frustrating beyond words.&quot;
$ Shah, 36, whose family immigrated to the U.S. from India, is now the Under Secretary for Research,
Education and Economics and Chief Scientist at the Agriculture Department where he manages a budget
of more than $2.6 billion and more than 10,000 staff around the world.
¶ Before that, he had several positions at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, including managing its
$1.5 billion contribution to a global vaccination fund and helping launch the foundation's Global
Development program where he oversaw a $1.3 billion investment portfolio.
The lingering USAID vacancy, particularly after several leading candidates pulled out, had upset
development experts and Congress. Some lawmakers had suggested that Obama choose someone who

    <body>KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan officials accused NATO-led troops of killing two school boys in central Afghanistan on October
23 after a patrol came under fire by Taliban insurgents, but foreign troops said the circumstances were unclear.
A statement released by the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said two civilians had possibly
been killed in the Maidan Shahr district of Wardak province, west of Kabul, when insurgents attacked the patrol.
&quot;During the attack, three Afghan citizens on a motorcycle entered the engagement area. Two of them fell off the
vehicle and were taken away by local villagers,&quot; ISAF said.
It said their condition could not be determined before they were taken away. The incident was under investigation,

    <body>Internet can help free US reporters in NKorea: Clinton
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Monday urged women students to use the Internet to campaign for the release
of two American women journalists held in North Korea. Clinton urged graduates of Barnard College, a women's
university in New York City, to show their opposition to Pyongyang's detention of the two journalists who are due to go
on trial on June 4.
&quot;We have two young women journalists right now imprisoned in North Korea and you can get busy on the Internet and
let the North Koreans know that we find that absolutely unacceptable,&quot; Clinton told the graduation ceremony.
Clinton was highlighting the new media tools that women can use to fight injustice around the world.
North Korea announced last Thursday that it had set a June 4 trial date for the two journalists — Euna Lee, a Korean-
American, and Laura Ling, a Chinese-American — but gave no details of the charges against them.
Clinton said afterward that the announcement of a trial date is &quot;a signal that there can be&quot; a resolution of the case soon,
even though she said the pair should be released immediately and the charges against them are &quot;baseless.&quot;
The North has previously said they would go on trial for &quot;hostile acts&quot; and illegally entering the country. Their trial would
be held &quot;on the basis of the confirmed crimes committed by them,&quot; it has announced.
While working on a story about refugees fleeing the hardline communist North, the pair were detained March 17 along
the narrow Tumen River which marks the border with China.

Uighurs. Big commitment for Palau since Chinese tourism was planned and its close geographically, etc. but their
premium is on U.S. relations (as sadly demonstrated by the loss of a Palauan in the U.S. Army in Afghanistan last week).
Also, just FYI now, I've been concerned that the Budget includes a far too low placeholder for free association

    <body>You asked about this. It was Walter Isaacson.
New BBG chief wants more money to combat &quot;enemies&quot; such as China and Russia Posted By Josh Rogin Tuesday,
October 5, 2010 - 4:43 PM
The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) has a new chairman in Walter Isaacson, and the former CNN and Time
magazine chief is calling for even more money for the BBG to combat the public diplomacy efforts of America's
&quot;enemies,&quot; which he identifies as Iran, Venezuela, Russia, and China.
The BBG, which oversees a $700 million annual budget to run such organizations as the Voice of America, Radio Free
Europe, and Radio Free Asia, funds breakthrough reporting in some of the most dangerous parts of the world, but at the
same time is facing increased competition from other governments' forays into international broadcasting.
Isaacson said that other countries are stepping up their international broadcasting efforts and that the Congress must
allow the U.S. government to do the same.
&quot;We can't allow ourselves to be out-communicated by our enemies,&quot; he said. &quot;You've got Russia Today, Iran's Press TV,
Venezuela's TeleSUR, and of course, China is launching an international broadcasting 24-hour news channel with
correspondents around the world [and has] reportedly set aside six to ten billion [dollars] -- we've to go to Capitol Hill
with that number -- to expand their overseas media operations.&quot;
Isaacson said that combating internet censorship would be a major focus of the BBG under his leadership and that China
and Iran were the prime targets.
&quot;China, Iran, and other countries block democratic impulses using their later technologies, and Beijing has deployed
armies of cyber militias to go after their country's cyber dissidents,&quot; he said. &quot;The BBG is at the forefront of combating
this. Through constant innovation and technical evolution, our engineers are opening up the Internet gateway for
audiences in China and Iran.&quot;
&quot;We know where we stand in the fight for Internet freedom,&quot; Isaacson said. &quot;Wherever there is a firewall, it's our duty
to storm it, to denounce it and to circumvent it.&quot;
Isaacson was speaking at last week's 60th anniversary celebration for Radio Free Europe, which he credited as
contributing to the end of the Cold War. He made it clear the BBG's outlets will stick to reporting the news objectively,
even if that conflicts with the foreign policy of the Obama administration.
&quot;It's sometimes said that our international broadcasting is in a difficult position because by law and by tradition it's
tasked with two separate missions that might conflict: first of all, covering the news with the highest journalistic
standards and secondly, being a part of America's public diplomacy by accurately conveying its policies and values to the
world,&quot; Isaacson said.
&quot;Let me say to you, my fellow journalists, that I will stress and we will stress the primacy of the first of these missions,
our mission of being credible journalists, because in fact, it's the only way to carry out the second mission. You can't do
it unless you're credible and telling the truth, and in the end, the truth is on our side.&quot;
Pressed by The Cable to explain exactly what that means, especially in light of reports that the Obama administration
sought to influence BBG reporting after the disputed Iranian presidential elections, Isaacson promised he wouldn't

Following is the text of a joint statement by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas
Store, and United Kingdom Foreign Secretary David Miliband on the upcoming national elections in Sudan.
Begin Text:
National elections in Sudan this month will represent a major milestone in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement that
ended Sudan's twenty-two year civil war, and are an important opportunity for the people of Sudan to participate in the
political process.
We urge all parties in Sudan to work urgently to ensure that elections can proceed peacefully and credibly in April. We
are deeply concerned by reports of continued administrative and logistical challenges, as well as restrictions on political
freedoms. We call on the Government of Sudan, the National Elections Commission, and all political parties to engage in
further dialogue to resolve practical obstacles, procedural impediments, and address allegations of intimidation,
harassment, and safety concerns, and other legitimate concerns raised by various political parties. We continue to urge
the parties to improve conditions on the ground in Darfur and create a secure environment conducive to Darfuri
participation.
Irrespective of the outcome of elections, it is essential that work continues and is accelerated to meet remaining CPA
deadlines. Progress is needed urgently to complete border demarcation, to establish the commissions that will

UNITED NATIONS, May 18 (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon plans to name former U.S.
President Bill Clinton as his special envoy to Haiti, U.N. officials said on Monday, in a move that could attract
investment in the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation and help stabilize the country. &quot;The announcement is
expected to come soon,&quot; one U.N. official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. The official said a formal
announcement could come as early as Tuesday. Clinton, who has galvanized efforts to help the impoverished
Caribbean nation recover from the devastating impact of four hurricanes last year, accompanied Ban on a trip to
Haiti earlier this year. Several other diplomats confirmed the appointment of the former president, who is trying

    <subject>AP/Afghanistan Sanctions</subject>
    <body>WASHINGTON (AP) - The Obama administration targeted key leaders of Afghanistan's Taliban with new financial
sanctions Thursday in a move that could complicate relations with Pakistan and Afghan efforts to reconcile with
insurgents.
The action by the Treasury Department will freeze the militants' assets, ban travel and trigger an arms embargo. It
follows similar action by the United Nations earlier this week, and comes after calls from Gen. David Petraeus, the top
military commander in Afghanistan, and Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, for
sanctions against Afghan insurgent commanders operating in Pakistan.
Taken together, the U.S. and U.N. sanctions prohibit any financial transactions of the terror leaders in U.N. member
countries, putting additional pressure on Pakistan to take broader actions against the Taliban militants.
Three financial kingpins were targeted with sanctions, including a key member of the Haqqani network, which,directs
operations against U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan from safe havens in Pakistan. Among those sanctioned
Thursday was Nasiruddin Haqqani, an emissary for the Haqqani Network and brother of Sirajuddin Haqqani who leads
the group with his father, Jalaluddin.
Others sanctioned included Gul Agha Ishakzai, the head of the Taliban's financial commission and Amir Abdullah, the
former treasurer to captured Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Barader. The sanctions placed on the three leaders as
terrorists would deprive them of the assets they need to fund their terror operations, said Adam J. Szubin, director of
Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. &quot;We will continue to aggressively work to expose and dismantle the financial
networks of terrorist groups in support of the president's goal of a stable Afghanistan,&quot; he said.
According to officials, lshakzai is the head of the Taliban's financial commission, has collected money for suicide attacks
in Kandahar, Afghanistan, and has been involved in the disbursement of funds for Taliban fighters. He has served as a
main financial officer and close adviser to Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar. Abdullah has reportedly traveled to
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Libya and the United Arab Emirates to raise money for the Taliban and facilitate meetings and

Vali--per your query, the cap I wore says &quot;USAID from the People of the United States&quot; and on the back &quot;DART&quot;. It was
practically the only sign, however temporary, that there was a US civilian effort in Sindh. So it got some media attention,
which was good.
Every other country's aid here, even Iran's, is better branded than us. Only our helicopters are visible. China's field
hospital (which I drove by in Thatta) Turkey, Saudi Arabia (I visited their refugee camp, where they are building a
mosque), Australia (field hospital in multan), Switzerland, UK, etc. While we hide and the NGO partners refuse to admit
that we fund them.
In addition, our employees are prevented from spending time in the affected areas, which they can visit only under very
stringent conditions and heavy security imposed by RSOs. For example, the fabled AID DART teamn can hardly get out of
l'bad and relies primarily on reports from NGois, a notably unreliable method.
We are going to try to change this. It won't be easy.

We've been hearing all day that Peter would take a back-me-or-sack-me public vote of his party. Hopefully tomorrow
will be the day -- and hopefully he'll be successful.
In an interesting show of strength, he has announced he'll resume as First Minister.

Statement by the Secretary
On the Restoration of Democratic and Constitutional Order In Honduras November 27, 2009
The United States remains committed to help restore the democratic and constitutional order in Honduras in the wake
of the June 28 coup d'etat that removed President Zelaya and led to the suspension of Honduras from the Organization
of American States. As part of that effort, it is essential for both parties in Honduras to implement the measures they
agreed to in the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord, including the formation of a government of unity and national
reconciliation and the December 2 congressional vote on President Zelaya&quot;s restitution. These are vital elements of the
Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord, and the Honduran people and the international community expect an expeditious
determination. We look forward to the Congressional deliberations getting underway as announced.
The November 29 national elections are another critical step in the restoration of the democratic and constitutional
order in Honduras. The electoral process -- launched well before June 28 and involving legitimate candidates
representing parties with longstanding democratic traditions from a broad ideological spectrum -- is conducted under
the stewardship of the non-partisan Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which was also selected before the coup. The electoral
renewal of presidential, congressional and mayoral mandates, enshrined in the Honduran constitution, is an inalienable
expression of the sovereign will of the citizens of Honduras. We wish the Honduran people well as they choose their

Dear Cheryl —
It's our understanding that the review of the terrorist list undertaken at the beginning of the year is reaching
completion, imminently. Jim asked me to shoot you a note that this continues to be a very important issue for
him and Bill Delahunt. The list needs to be purged of political manipulation — and quite frankly, the current
status quo with Cuba needs to be broken, not further reinforced — for the sake of Alan Gross, those on the island
needing space to voice their views, and indeed, all of us outside who know change is coming.
It's time to do something bold and constructive — and in our very best interests —
Let us know if there's anything we can do to help —

Yes, and a draft of the testimony.
I'd like a call this afternoon or evening to go over the draft Af-Pak regional strategy. Who should be on call? It is quite
good but lacks &quot;milestones&quot; and budgets for each section.
Sounds good. Huma and I will work to set it up. The budget issue is complicated -- we've had several discussions about
it. It's hard to put down numbers with confidence.
Call should be with Jack, Piper, Rich, Paul Jones, and Sean Misko.
Re the required report for Kerry-Lugar, I want to be sure that the language in both our report and this one echo the
same language.
Paul, Sean, and Rich are going back over to make sure of that. Our chief method is to use framing language from the
strategy to frame the KLB report as well.
I never called Patricia Espinosa--should I?
Will check with WHA.

Re: The Downing Street meeting today
Today a seven hour meeting took place at Downing Street to attempt to determine Gordon's strategy. The
participants were Gordon, Shaun, Peter, Alastair Campbell, and Ed Balls (who is close to Gordon).
Gordon has made a maximum proposal to Clegg through intermediaries, including a referendum on
proportional representation, program, cabinet slots if Clegg wants them, or not if he prefers to be
perceived as above dealmaking. The offer is open, too, and can be added to. Gordon is letting Cameron
and Clegg have their conversation without going public. Clegg in private is in something of a state of
shock. He actually expected to win about 125 seats—and finished at 57, losing 14 from what the Lib-
Dems held. While Clegg is out front he cannot make a deal on his own; he requires his party's backing.
Gordon and his people are in touch with people close to Clegg. Many of Clegg's senior people will not
support the deal that Cameron has proposed. Vincent Cable, Clegg's number two, the shadow
chancellor, is unhappy with the Tory deal. Clegg is therefore at sea. Clegg's party base, moreover,
would not approve a deal that did not represent a &quot;progressive&quot; position. Much of the Lib-Dem base is
idealistic and subject to disillusionment.
Gordon is doing whatever he can to hold on to power. Shaun, for his part, is working on an economic
package for Northern Ireland to win support from the DUP and other parties for Labour—a package to
be proposed in the Queen's Speech. Peter floats in and out of the meeting and appears on TV. Alastair

    <body>This is not a fair assessment of the position we have taken. We have more than tripled to level of assistance from what
was proposed in the last Administration and have expressed flexibility about how to structure it. Jeff has consistently

Subject: Only Palau &amp; Israel vote w/US in UN
Wed., Palau was one of only two UN General Assembly members to vote with the US against a resolution calling
for an end to the US embargo of Cuba (Israel was the other). Even the two other states in free association with the US.
did not support the US position. Important officials in Palau wanted to abstain because of the drastic cut in U.S.
assistance that Alcy Frelick has insisted on but Pres. Toribiong decided to stick with the US. The proposal to cut the small
amount of assistance that Palau is receiving is ironic in light of the substantial increase in assistance pledged to the two
other freely associated states just a few years ago. It is also misinformed and misguided.

Statement by Ambassador Mark Sedwill, NATO's Senior Civilian Representative to Afghanistan
Stan McChrystal is one of the finest men I have ever known. He is and will remain a lifelong
friend.
General McChrystal has also been an outstanding military commander who was pivotal in
creating and driving forward NATO's strategy in Afghanistan to regain the initiative against
the insurgency, resolve the political tensions which fuel it and transition responsibility to the
Government of Afghanistan as we help build their capabilities.
This strategy remains the basis of the campaign. The campaign remains on course. The
Afghan people should have no doubt of our commitment to build a stable Afghanistan and a
safer world.
I look forward to working with General David Petraeus whose remarkable track record speaks
for itself. He will provide the continuity and strong leadership required to meet the challenges

Subject: Ruto and the &quot;No&quot; team concede defeat in Kenya's Constitutional Referendum
Colleagues,
Shortly before 2 PM Nairobi time, William Ruto and the &quot;No&quot; team conceded defeat. Saying that &quot;Kenyans have
spoken&quot; and that the constitution has been accepted at the referendum, Ruto said that he will now focus on fixing the
contentious issues outlined by the &quot;No&quot; team by participating in the implementation process. Somewhat
disingenuously, Ruto is also saying that a &quot;majority of Kenyans either did not vote or voted against the new
constitution.&quot; He has urged his supporters to remain peaceful and accept the outcome.
At about 1 PM, church leaders held a press conference acknowledging the draft has passed, and stating that the church
will work to address the new constitution's &quot;moral issues of concern.&quot;
On a personal note, I will be departing post tomorrow morning and will leave the office in a few hours. It has been an
honor and privilege to work with a wonderful team in support of Kenya's constitutional reform, and I am thankful to
have witnessed such a peaceful and positive outcome. I wish my colleagues the best as they turn now to the task of
supporting the implementation. Glenn Warren (WarrenGS@state.gov / +254-717-727-842) is the primary point of
contact for constitutional issues going forward.

In response to your query about the possibility of going to Goma, I reached out to our colleagues in Embassy Kinshasa to
see what has been done in the past. The only reasonably safe way to get to Goma is flying on a MONUC aircraft
originating from Kinshasa. That would mean a two hour flight each way, leaving a very small window (probably no more
than one hour) to work in events. Moreover, advancing Goma would pose a significant challenge for us for security

I hope this note finds you and your family doing well. I've been following all of your activities over the last several

shot at best, but we are having a dinner for our group at the Hay Adams on Tuesday, May 19 and it would be a
tremendous honor if you would come by and say a few words. If this doesn't work but you are in town, I'd love to stop
by for 5 minutes to say hello. Please let me know if any of this is possible. I look forward to seeing you soon.
All my best,

Re: Post mid-terms strategy
What I hear from Republican sources and elsewhere and what it means for Republican strategy:
1. Rove is telling his donors that the ticket in 2012 is Romney/Barbour. Haley Barbour is Rove's ally. Together they
constitute the heart of the GOP establishment. In a potential Republican administration Barbour would be a new kind of
Cheney, but more politically skillful.
2. Rove is at war with Palin. He has told his donors she must be stopped. Palin is well aware. The Politico story filled with
anonymous quotes about a murky establishment vs. Palin is about the Death Star of Rove/Barbour. Ironies: Rove doubled
down on a base strategy for Bush, galvanizing the right wing, now spun out of his control to Palin. The GOP used the far
right and Palin in the mid-terms and now have to kill them in presidential nomination politics. Attacking Palin only builds
her stature with the right. She plays instinctively to the base, but can she play a long game against the big boys
determined to destroy her?
3. Palin has already aligned Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh on her side. Fox News is being split. Murdoch gave his big
donation to the Republican Governors Association, headed by Barbour.
4. Malcolm Hoenlein has been raising money hand over fist for the Republicans through Eric Cantor, now his vehicle. The
donors are many of the same US donors to Bibi and Likud. Implications obvious.
5. The House Republicans have already'planned to primary all Senate Republican moderates in the next cycle. Olympia
Snowe is a particular target.
6. In the Senate, Jim DeMint continues to be a Fifth Column of the right, allied to the House Republicans, against remaining
Senate GOP moderates. He will be reinforced after this election with Rand Paul, et al. Paul, of course, hates Mitch
McConnell, and vice versa.
7. McConnell's statement the day before the mid-terms that the goal of the GOP is to make Obama a one term president is,
in fact, their agenda. Everything in the House and Senate will be bent to that end.
8. Can the House Republicans and Senate Republicans restrain themselves in their own interest and McConnell's stated
aim? Boehner is despised by the younger, more conservative members of the House Republican Conference. They are
repelled by his personal behavior. He is louche, alcoholic, lazy, and without any commitment to any principle. Boehner
has already tried to buy the members with campaign contributions and committee assignments, which he has already
promised to potentially difficult members. His hold is insecure. He is not Gingrich, the natural leader of a &quot;revolution,&quot;
riding the crest into power. He is careworn and threadbare, banal and hollow, holding nobody's enduring loyalty. Boehner
is beholden and somewhat scared of his base. He twitches when they make gestures that might undermine his position.
His impulse is to hand out money. His aim is to recreate DeLay, Inc, with Jerry Lewis, who will be the new chairman of
Appropriations. But Boehner is neither feared nor loved. He's a would-be DeLay without the whip. He's the one at the end
of the lash. Which means he will be under great pressure and find it hard to sustain a moderate, reasonable strategy of

so I fear if she doesn't call til afternoon on 31st (Turkey/Armenia time) we won't get it done.

® Jim said that he had spoken to Senator DeMint about holds on Valenzuela and Shannon. DeMint did not say
anything negative about either nominee, but will insist on a full floor discussion as the price of a vote. (He sees
no prospect Zelaya will come back into power in Honduras.) H will follow up to see what more can be done to
engage with DeMint on the substance of his concerns. Cheryl noted that if we are not going to make any
additional movement soon, we should proceed to a floor vote. The issue then will be how much time DeMint
demands.

other measures to increase security.

® In Honduras, Pat noted that the mission is also closed and that, despite the proximity of our mission to the
Brazilian things seem fine. I noted that there were reports this morning that police had fired tear gas to break

FYI below on French statement on Haiti and U.S. support:
Paris, January 19, 2010
COMMUNIQUE
During their telephone conversation last week, the President of the Republic and President Obama expressed the
resolute commitment of our two countries in Haiti, and decided to combine their efforts in order to deal with the urgent
humanitarian situation and to respond, in the future, to the enormous reconstruction requirements.
The French authorities have, since then, been entirely satisfied with the cooperation between our two countries and,
beyond that, the continuous coordination between the Crises Centers of the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs
and the U.S. Department of State. They want to pay tribute to the United States' extraordinary mobilization efforts in
support of Haiti and the vital role it is playing on the ground.

h: FYI, Iran document Gary Sick sent me. Sid
From Gary Sick
Mojtaba Samareh Hashemi is a senior adviser to President Ahmadinejad and a devoted proponent of the Divine Right of
Kings doctrine of ultra-conservative ayatollah Mesbah-Yazdi. Many regard him as an eminence grise of the Iranian regime
and an important bridge between the Revolutionary Guards, the fanatic-fringe ayatollahs, and the presidency. So his
words are worth listening to as clues to what is happening inside the closed circles of the Iranian leadership.
Today he was quoted by the Fars news agency (in Persian) on the troublesome issue of U.S.-Iran relations. Although the
statement was translated into English, it needs more than a word-for-word translation in order to be understood. So I have
added my own interpretation of what Mojtaba really meant to say.
&quot;Obama not only did not manage to realize his slogan [of change], but has pursued the dark policies of Bush all over the
world ever more energetically...&quot;
[real meaning: Oh, how we miss George Bush! He was such an easy target. With him we were winning everywhere and
America's credibility was falling to the point of disappearance even among its friends.]
&quot;The Bush presidency is one of the darkest eras of the United States and the greatest hatred emerged internationally
towards the United States...&quot;
[Why can't Obama be more like Bush? In the good old days we didn't have to keep answering questions about why we
would not accept an outstretched hand of friendship. It was all so much easier then.]
&quot;Today we see that the United States rather than moving its military forces out of Iraq and Afghanistan has increased their
number which has led to mass murder of the people and increased impoverishment in these countries. Obama had said
that he wanted to oppose violation of human rights and wanted to close Guantanamo and secret prisons in Europe. Did
this happen? Of course not...&quot;
[The United States has announced its withdrawal from Iraq and actually seems to be on schedule; in the meantime, our
favorite parties and politicians in Iraq have not done all that well in the Iraqi elections despite our support. The Shi'i
religious leaders in Najaf openly dismiss the idea of an Islamic Republic and are increasingly competing with us, instead
of following our lead. In Afghanistan, the Americans seem to be serious about announcing a date certain for withdrawal,
and they even seem to be edging up to a Karzai reconciliation strategy with the Taliban. How can we attack them with a
straight face when they behave this way!]
&quot;There has also not been any correction of the dark policy of Bush towards Iran's nuclear program or [the United State's]
opposition towards the Iranian nation...&quot;
[Their willingness to meet with us and that dastardly offer of a uranium swap were hugely embarrassing. Now every time
we sit down with a foreign leader we have to listen to tiresome suggestions that we should reconsider our position on the
uranium swap — even from the Russians and Chinese. You can't trust anyone these days!]
&quot;We do not want anything from the United States. The Iranian nation demands its rights to be recognized and
respected...&quot;
[All we want from the Americans is the return of George Bush! Even John McCain would be an improvement. I wonder if
Sarah Palin has any chance? We'll keep our fingers crossed.]
&quot;The Islamic Republic has not become isolated, rather, it is expanding [its foreign relations] ever more and is finding new

Only Palau &amp; Israel vote w/US in UN
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767667 Date: 07/31/2015
RELEASE IN PART
B6
Wed., Palau was one of only two UN General Assembly members to vote with the U.S against a
resolution calling for an end to the US embargo of Cuba (Israel was the other). Even the two
other states in free association with the US. did not support the US position. important officials
in Palau wanted to abstain because of the drastic cut in.U.S. assistance that Alcy Frelick has
insisted on but Pres. Toribiong decided to stick with the US. The proposal to cut the small
amount of assistance that Palau is receiving is ironic in light of the substantial increase in
assistance pledged to the two other freely associated states just a few years ago. It is also
misinformed and misguided.

Cheryl, Jake,
I owe you both an apology. I had a very productive flight (8-10 hours in a darkened quiet cabin is just what I needed) and
finished Les Gelb's book -- it is astonishing how close our analyses are -- he says that foundation of US power is to
catalyze others to get problems solved. HRC wanted me to make the speech harder and I see some very good ways to do
that -- talking about assembling power coalitions to deal w/ troublesome states, a term Les uses.
But I also had a chance to reread the frame that you put together, much more carefully. There are a number of very
good things in it that I am going to try to work into a revision, or at least flag for how we can build off of this speech in
subsequent speeches. I am sorry that I didn't see that in the press of trying to get to this point.
I will have a revision by Sunday afternoon China time, which would allow her and you to see it Sunday morning.

ZARDARI CALLS FOR FLOOD TAX
By Syed Irfan Raza
DAWN Thursday, 30 Sep, 2010
ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari asked the government on Wednesday to levy a one-time flood tax on wealthy
people.
&quot;A one-time flood tax will have to be imposed on the well-off and people of means to help shore up relief and
rehabilitation efforts,&quot; he said at a meeting of women ministers, parliamentarians and representatives of non-
governmental organisations.
&quot;Unless we are prepared to share bread with our grief- and disaster-stricken brethren, we should not expect others to
help us.
&quot;I have already advised the government to tap into indigenous resources wherever there is room,&quot; he said.

Subject: Stevens Update (important)
(SBU) Per Special Envoy Stevens:
• The situation in Ajdabiyah has worsened to the point where Stevens is considering departure from Benghazi. The
envoy's delegation is currently doing a phased checkout (paying the hotel bills, moving some comms to the boat,
etc). He will monitor the situation to see if it deteriorates further, but no decision has been made on departure. He will
wait 2-3 more hours, then revisit the decision on departure.
He received reports of shelling last night in Ajdabiyah as well as snipers shooting people in the city. AFRICOM
reported Qadhafi's forces took the eastern and western gates of Ajdabiyah, with 5 vehicles at the eastern gate and 50 at
the western gate. More Qadhafi forces are heading to Ajdabiyah from Brega.
The Brits report Qadhafi forces are moving from Sirte to Brega, which they interpret as preparation for another
assault on Ajdabiyah today.
He plans to discuss the situation further with the Brits, Turks, and the TNC to see if this is an irreversible
situation. Departure would send a significant political signal, and would be interpreted as the U.S. losing confidence in
the TNC. Initial message to the TNC would frame the departure as due to security grounds and as a temporary measure
only.
Polaschik said she would discuss these developments with Amb. Cretz.
If the group departs, the contract for the boat stipulates they return to Greece. One scenario could be the group
stages elsewhere for a few days.
Ops will continue to monitor the situation.

conditioning of the normalization of Turkish-Armenian relations on steps toward the settlement of the Karabakh
conflict. Trying to link these two processes could lead to the failure of both. A number of countries, including
those of the Minsk Group Co-Chairs, have the same position. They have said many times that the normalization
of relations between Turkey and Armenia must be without preconditions. With this mutual understanding, we
have started and conducted negotiations and come to agreements that are reflected in the initialed protocols. If
the Turkish leadership has problems with the signing of these documents, they should not try to solve them by
distorting the spirit, essence, and goals of the initialed documents. The signing and implementation of the
agreed documents is a process that is full of difficulties. Nevertheless, Armenia is ready to respect the
agreements and move forward If the current authorities in Turkey are not ready to accept the fact of the
genocide perpetrated in the Ottoman Empire, then they are at least obliged to show respect toward the
survivors of the Armenian genocide and their descendants.&quot;

We had a long dinner. It was, I think, fruitful for her. (I recall Greg Craig there, then as head of Policy Planning.) There are

There are of course a number of people who have not been tapped into the administration and wish to be.

    <body>I am a former British diplomat. In the course of my former duties I helped to coordinate multilateral action against a
brutal regime in the Balkans, impose sanctions on a renegade state threatening ethnic cleansing, and negotiate a
debt relief programme for an impoverished nation. None of this would have been possible without the security and
secrecy of diplomatic correspondence, and the protection of that correspondence from publication under the laws of
the UK and many other liberal and democratic states. An embassy which cannot securely offer advice or pass
messages back to London is an embassy which cannot operate. Diplomacy cannot operate without discretion and the
protection of sources. This applies to the UK and the UN as much as the US.
In publishing this massive volume of correspondence, Wikileaks is not highlighting specific cases of wrongdoing but
undermining the entire process of diplomacy. If you can publish US cables then you can publish UK telegrams and UN
emails.
My question to you is: why should we not hold you personally responsible when next an international crisis goes
unresolved because diplomats cannot function.
Julian Assange:
If you trim the vast editorial letter to the singular question actually asked, I would be happy to give it my attention.

National Security Threats Posed by Climate Change and Our Dependence on Foreign Oil
Dear,
I've spent my entire life working to keep America safe. That is why I feel compelled to add my voice to the growing
number of senior U.S. generals, admirals, and veterans calling for immediate actions to address the alarming national
security threats posed by climate change and our dependence on foreign oil.
We import over half our oil from countries that are hostile to us. Last year, we paid over $255 BILLION to Middle
Eastern countries that are the primary funders for terrorists groups like Al Qaeda and to Russia and Venezuela.
The U.S. consumes more energy than any other country in the world, so increased U.S. fuel efficiency standards and
reliance on renewable energy will directly affect not only our own economic prosperity, but world energy prices as well.
That matters because when the cost of a barrel of crude oil increases $10, the Ayatollah Khamenei in Iran gets $15
billion more, Putin in Russia gets an extra $36 billion, and Hugo Chavez in Venezuela gets an additional $10 billion to
prop up his anti-American regime.
Furthermore, since the military is the largest energy consumer in the U.S., that same $10/barrel increase means DoD has
to spend $1.3 billion more on fuel, which is equal to the entire procurement budget for the Marine Corps.
But our reliance on foreign oil does more than fund our enemies. The droughts, famines, and rising sea levels caused by
climate change pose perhaps the greatest destabilizing influence the world will face over the next 50 years.
Forty percent of the world's population gets its drinking water from mountain glaciers that could disappear within
decades. Without forceful and decisive action, conflict will likely erupt among climate refugees competing for dwindling
resources and political destabilization will create ungoverned spaces where terrorists can flourish. These effects were
seen in Afghanistan in the 1990s and are currently being experienced in Somalia and Darfur, were genocide erupted
following the drying of Lake Chad, leaving 300,000 dead.
We must act now. A huge coalition of faith and military leaders have joined together to support efforts in Congress to
pass effective climate change legislation this year. We need you to add your voice to ours by taking 1 minute to
encourage your Member of Congress to support this effort. Please click here to email or call your Representative.

Hillary: Spoke with Jonathan Powell. What we heard is accurate. More: Labour will suffer a large defeat in the European
elections on June 4. (New poll in Guardian shows widespread disaffection with all parties as a result of the Commons
expenses scandal; 27 percent voting for fringe parties.) Gordon will attempt to overwhelm news coverage of the loss
with a cabinet reshuffle, as early as the next day, June 5. The plot (sounds like the Tudors): David is the target, from
multiple angles and motives, personal ambition mixed with anti-Blairism. Peter has always wanted to be Foreign
Secretary, a job held by his grandfather, Herbert Morrison. (Morrison was also deputy PM, why doesn't Peter want
that?) New Labour people regard Peter as more ambitious than New Labour at this point. He supported Gordon's utterly
misbegotten and wildly unpopular proposal to raise the top tax rate to 50 percent. The fallout is less resentment of the
affluent to paying more or grudging understanding of need for new revenues as it is a sense that Labour under Gordon is
abandoning the project for social aspiration and opportunity that is at the heart of the New Labour message. Ed Balls,
one of Gordon's closest longtime advisers, is also determined to topple David. Balls is a contemporary of David's, wants
to be leader of the party himself, and continues the Gordon v. Tony bitter rivalry into the future. Balls is currently
Minister for Children and Schools and was linked to Damian McBride (Gordon's hatchetman, who has trashed Blairites,
got caught out on his blogging scheme to smear Cameron). If Gordon names Peter to David's job, Balls would take
Peter's and become Business Secretary. David would be pushed into Home Secretary. Once Balls takes Peter's job, Balls
will likely reverse Peter's privatization proposal for the Royal Mail to win support from party's left-wing base, beginning
of his campaign against David for post-Gordon leadership struggle. Tony sees the situation as terminal. Hope to speak wi
th him soon. He is trying to become President of Europe if and when Lisbon treaty passes. Jonathan made an interesting
and ironic comment about Colin Powell, given Tony's deference to him, that Powell's flaw was being too deferential to

    <body>Subject Strategy session
Cheryl and I discussed how to do an effective strategy session. Monday early afternoon is the first clear shot we have at
getting the right group of people in the room together for an extended period of time.
We propose to start the discussion from the following premise: We've addressed, in one fashion or another, to one
degree of satisfaction or another, most of the major items we set out at the beginning of last near. We've moved the
needle, but we haven't changed the game. Now the question is, what are the major milestones over the next 12-18
months? What should we be aiming at? And especially, what are some potential game-changers — moves that would
shift the global landscape in meaningful and long-lasting ways?
Everything will be on the table — regional issues, transnational issues, etc. Everyone should read the book of look-ahead
papers; identify things they think we should pursue; and add ideas — especially creative and far-reaching ideas — on top
of what's contained in them.
We propose the following roster:
Jim
Jack
Bill
AMS
Derek
CDM

Subject: (Reuters) Pakistan makes arrests connected to NYC bomb attempt
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan on May 4 made several arrests in connection with the failed Times Square car bomb
attack in New York, security sources said.
&quot;We have picked up a few family members&quot; related to Faisal Shahzad, the chief suspect in the attempted attack, a
security official in Karachi said. A friend of Shahzad was also arrested.
Shahzad, a 30-year-old Pakistani-American, was arrested late on May 3 at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New
York after being removed from a plane as it was about take off for Dubai, American officials said.
Another intelligence official in Pakistan said Shahzad received militant training in northwest Pakistan near the garrison
town of Kohat. The area around Kohat is a stronghold of Tariq Afridi, the main Pakistani Taliban commander in the
region.
Pakistan, which could come under renewed U.S. pressure to crack down harder on militants after the Times Square
incident, vowed to help the United States bring Shahzad to justice
Shahzad will appear in Manhattan federal court to face charges &quot;for allegedly driving a car bomb into Times Square on
the evening of May 1&quot;, according to a statement by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, FBI agent George Venizelos and New
York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly.
&quot;We will cooperate with the United States in identifying this individual and bringing him to justice,&quot; Interior Minister
Rehman Malik told Reuters.
U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson met Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and Malik and
talked about the issue, Pakistani government officials and the U.S. Embassy said.

Dear Cheryl and Ambassador Jacobs,

and Jim has to accept this invitation,
so he is going with them. It's our understanding that Senator Kerry has been or will be invited, as well. It's
also our understanding that Lynn University will be providing the air transport to Haiti.
Jim, first and foremost, wanted you to know this is happening. Second, he asks that whatever permissions he
and the a.tnilv/Lynn University delegation might need to enter Haiti, for Lynn University to land their
aircraft, and for them to go to and review the Hotel Montana USAR operation be granted and expedited.

Below is the statement of very impressive Palau reps at the end of a session of required meetings on the next phase of
free association aid. FYI only, the Palauans were insulted by the nature and depth of the response to their proposal as
well as the content and the overall approach. They are even privately questioning the relationship. (This hasn't affected
their intent to take the Uighurs.) I will send a few further thoughts.
At the conclusion of yesterday's meeting, the Palau delegation caucused to discuss its reaction to the response of the
United States delegation to the proposals that it made in June in Washington D.C., and expanded upon in subsequent
communications.
While the Palau delegation has agreed to respond to certain additional questions raised by the United States delegation
on specific elements of the Palau proposal, and further has agreed to participate in certain working groups on specific
issues, the Palau delegation was deeply disappointed with the response of the United States delegation. The United
States delegation did not seriously respond, as required by the Compact, to the operational requirements of the
Government of Palau or to Palau's comprehensive and considered plans to achieve economic advancement and self-

Richard Momoima Onyonka is a Kenyan politician and belongs to the People's Democratic Party. Born in 1962 and
hailing from the Bogeka clan, VM Momoima has lived in Otamba, Nyamataro, Mosocho and Nairobi. In 1982, following
the failed Kenyan coup d'etat attempt to overthrow President Daniel Arap Moi's government, VM Momoima was among
the 900 people that were jailed. However, in 1984, he returned to the University of Nairobi and graduated with a
Bachelors degree in commerce a year later. After graduation, VM Momoima attended North Carolina State University
where he graduated with a Masters degree in management. He returned to Kenya in 1992 during the first multi party
elections to help his father (then incumbent MP for Kitutu Chache and Minister for Planning and National Development)
who was seeking re-election on a KANU (Kenya African National Union) ticket. VM Momoima's first political opportunity
arose when his father passed away in 1996, which prompted an election in which he lost to a new corner during the
party (KANU) nominations. Since the Kenyan parliamentary election in 2007, VM Momoima has represented the Kitutu
Chache Constituency in the National Assembly of Kenya.
A financial economist by profession, VM Momoima currently runs personal businesses in Nairobi and Kisii and has held
